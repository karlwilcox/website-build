## Build files for the karlwilcox.com website

There's nothing of great interest here since the content is all available on https://karlwilcox.com anyway.
This repository is simply the off-line backup of the Jekyll source files used to do the build the static content.

The build process must be run on a Linux host as it uses bash scripts, the 'make' program and the presence of
imagemagick.

Originally the theme was based on [Feeling Responsive](https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/) but
has been radically hacked around behind the scenes. For other credits see https://karlwilcx.com/info/
