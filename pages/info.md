## Tools

The site consists entirely of static pages created using the [Jekyll][1]] Static Site Generator. Development
work is carried out a Mini-PC running [Pop!OS][2], for text editing I use IntelliJ Idea from [JetBrains][3]
with the IdeaVim(*) plugin and a colour theme that I can't seem to settle on and changes every few weeks.

(*) The first editor I learned to use, some 40 years ago, was Vi and the muscle memory is too ingrained to change now!

The page theme is [FEELING RESPONSIVE][4] by phlow.

All images, diagrams, photographs etc. are my own work unless otherwise stated. I use the various tools provided by
[Affinity Software][5] for image preparation and diagram creation.

## Hosting

As above, development work is done on my Pop!OS Linux Mini-PC which hosts multiple test versions of 
my various websites each on a different IP addresses.

The live website is hosted by Amazon Web Services on a tiny [LightSail][6] instance but since it is only
static pages both performance and storage are adequate.
