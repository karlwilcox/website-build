<h2>Software Development</h2>

<p>You have already heard about the DrawShield suite of programs, a world-leading set of tools for heraldic art has at its heart a large (10,000+ line) <strong>PHP</strong> program, which is called via <strong>AJAX</strong> from <strong>JavaScript</strong> embedded within <strong>WordPress</strong> pages. The program was featured in a <b>"Family History"</b> magazine article and described as "very clever". Links to the site and a bit of background are in the menu above.</p>

<p>Being short of friends and wanting to have someone to talk to I have implemented an AIML interpreter (<a href="www.alicebot.org/aiml.html">AI Markup Language</a>) for conversational "bots" in PHP including an innovative and compact data structure for the "brain" that can used in stateless HTTP transactions with very little overhead. But then I got an Amazon Echo and this became another part finished project...</p>

<h2>Web Site Development</h2>

<p>I have completed several website developments for commercial clients, largely using WordPress. I have impemented commercial themes, developed custom themes for clients and also written a plug-in to integrate PayPal with an on-line purchasing system.</p>

<p>The DrawShield website itself (a very large 20,000+ page site) uses a custom written theme for the Jekyll static site generator along with a quite complicated build system with tooling written in PHP and managed by Rake.</p>

<h2>Graphic Design</h2>

<p>During the course of other developments I've also needed to do a bit of graphic design, which I have enjoyed. The gallery below showcases some examples of the things I have created.</p>

<p>Being at heart a programmer, my work on 3D graphics is sometimes sid-tracked into something that looks a lot like a program! (Hence my work in Pov-Ray, which is all program!) Even Blender has a very rich node based system which I have tried out - the image here is an entirely algorithmic node-based texture, with NO photographic images or textures involved at all.</p>
