<p>I have had long experience of computing, starting with a teletype terminal connected to a dial-up time sharing system at my secondary school (writing 40 line BASIC programs for 'O' level Computer Science!) and moving on to a Sinclair ZX81 with 1K of RAM...</p>

<p>Some of that computing history I am gathering here, initially a project to create an<a href="https://karlwilcox.com/vintage-computing/products-of-the-chase-group/" data-type="page" data-id="1834"> archive of the products of the Chase Group of Companies.</a></p>

<p>Other areas of vintage computing may be added as I come across them.</p>
