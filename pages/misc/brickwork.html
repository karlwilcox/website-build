<h1>Under Construction!</h1><p>It has come to my attention that many depictions of brick built buildings fall woefully short of reality - offering just a simple
end-to-end laying of bricks and obvious repetition artifacts! This page, when completed will help you to resolve some of the following
issues:</p><dl><dt>Brick bonds</dt><dd>Most readily available brick images are of bricks laid along their long edges, with
    alternate rows overlapping. This pattern (properly known as a "bond") is only correct for
    modern, straight, single thickness brick walls. Other walls, especially older double thickness
    walls used many different patterns for different purposes. Indeed, you will often find
    differently coloured bricks used to bring out these patterns.</dd><dt>Repitition</dt><dd>Flood filling causes the pattern to repeat, which can create unsightly artifacts when used
    over large areas. We should create each brick individually and the user should have complete control
    over how similar (or different!) it is to its neighbour. Every brick is unique!</dd><dt>Perfection!</dt><dd>In a similar fashion, flood fills are "perfect", the pattern repeats in exactly the same
    position, again this can lead to visible artifacts over large areas. We should be able to
    simulate various degrees of skill in the brick-layer, or age of wall to
    slightly displace some of the bricks.</dd><dt>Corners</dt><dd>When real walls reach a corner they do not end at arbitrary points along the brick. They
    end at either on a full length or half length brick. Smaller "closer" bricks will be used to
    fill the pattern. We should be able to correctly use and place closers.</dd><dt>Edges and gaps</dt><dd>Like corners, where there are window or door voids, real bricks do not end arbitrarily.
    Often, such voids are an integral number of bricks apart, and if not, closer bricks are used or
    mortar gaps extended.</dd></dl><p>I have written a PHP program to generate brick patterns, but I have not yet written the web page
interface for it. Please be patient! In the meantime, sit back, relax and look at this example of the
output:</p>
