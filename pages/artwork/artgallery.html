<h2>Art Gallery</h2>
I am not a great artist, but I enjoy what I do. I haven't quite found a preferred medium yet, and dabble in quite a few, and I would like to share some of the "best" with you here.

<h3>Steampunk!</h3>
This is something that I would like to work on more in the future as I love the Steampunk visual style. Just for starters here are a few simple luggage labels and a couple of other bits...

<h3>Line Drawings</h3>

Mostly using Copic Multiliner Technical Pens in various widths.

<h3>Manga Backgrounds</h3>
I like the simple accuracy of Manga, clean lines with realistic perspective; especially scenic backgrounds. Most these started life as pencil and ink outlines on cartridge paper, which were then scanned and coloured in Smith Micro's <em>Clip Studio Pro</em> (previously <em>Manga Studio</em>).

<h3>Manga People</h3>
Realistic people are much harder! These all started life as photographs, (or screenshots from some Studio Ghibli films that you might recognise). I then hand draw with pen lines and scan into <em>Clip Studio Pro</em>, or hand colour with colouring pens.

<h2>Computer Generated Imagery</h2>
As with my hand drawn art, I have dabbled in various packages, although when I do get the time I am concentrating on <em>Blender</em>. Some examples of how I got here are shown below. They were variously created in <em>Bryce, POVray</em> and <em>Blender.</em>

<h2>Architecture Sketches</h2>
I like sketching and colouring buildings, as they generally have straight lines and don't move!
