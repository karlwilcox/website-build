I have long had an interest in 3D graphics, I particularly enjoy hard surface modelling and programming node based textures. As with my hand drawn art, I have dabbled in various packages, although when I do get the time I am concentrating on <em>Blender</em>. Some examples of how I got here are shown below. They were variously created in&nbsp;<em>Bryce, POVray</em> and&nbsp;<em>Blender. </em>

I've also done some work in vector based artwork using Clip Studio, Inkscape and Affinity Designer, these are included below.
