## Iain M. Banks - Culture Series

Iain is without a doubt my favourite author in any genre, in particular the Science Fiction and
most especially the Culture Series (remember what I was saying about comfort reads?) If I have to
pick an absolute favourite it would probably be "Look to Windward".

Over the years I've owned various editions but now the pride of my collection is the 13 volume
paperback series you can see here. Not only do they nicely coloured covers, if you line them
up correctly there is a nice swirly pattern across the spines! Kudos to Orbitbooks for
bringing out the complete matching set and doing such a good job of it.

## William Gibson - The Neuromancer Series
