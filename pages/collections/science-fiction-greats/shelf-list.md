(From right to left on the shelf)

## Iain M. Banks - Culture Series

Iain is without a doubt my favourite author in any genre, in particular the
Science Fiction and most especially the Culture Series (remember what I was
saying about comfort reads?) If I have to pick an absolute favourite it would
probably be "Look to Windward".

Over the years I've owned various editions but now the pride of my collection
is the 13 volume paperback series you can see here. Not only do they nicely
coloured covers, if you line them up correctly there is a nice swirly pattern
across the spines! Kudos to Orbitbooks for bringing out the complete matching
set and doing such a good job of it.

## William Gibson - The Neuromancer Series

Ground breaking and deeply immersive. I really like the world building through
the use of jargon and language that is explained later (if at all), it is just
assumed that we are familiar with that world which brings us right into it.
Great stories and iconic characters too.

Three novels, __Neuromancer__, __Mona Lisa Overdrive__ and __Count Zero__ with matching cover designs.

## Robert Heinlein - A Selection

Robert Heinlein was another of the "big three" (along with Clarke and Asimov)
whose works I devoured endlessly in my teenage years. I've represented his work
here with what are widely regarded as his best works, although at the time I
probably preferred the juvenile stories like __Have Spacesuit Will Travel__,
__Tunnel in the Sky__ and __Time for the Stars__ (although I also had a soft
spot for __The Door Into Summer__).

Works included so far, __Starship Trooper__, __Stranger in a Strange Land__ and
__The Moon is a Harsh Mistress__, with matching covers.

## Neal Stephenson - A Selection

These were readings from somewhat later life, after university (and still
reading SF!). I've chosen __Snow Crash__ and __The Diamond Age__ as I really
enjoyed both of those, as always with me, it is the world building that I
really enjoy and the immersion in the sub-creation. I did also enjoy
__Cryptonomicon__ although it is more alt-history than straight Science
Fiction.

Two paperbacks, vaguely matching covers.

## Kim Stanley Robinson - The Mars Trilogy

I enjoyed these soon after they first came out, although I thought they were a
bit "conversation" heavy and, especially the later ones, lacked a bit of
action. However, a recent re-read has re-confirmed to me what a great
achievement they are. Kim demonstrates a knowledge of huge range of subjects
and weaves them brilliantly into a detailed future history. Yes, there is a lot
of talking, and no, apart froma few big set pieces, there sometimes isn't a lot
happening but there's still something compelling about these when you are
reading them. I also have __The Martians__ in my to-be-read pile...

__Red Mars__, __Blue Mars__, __Green Mars__ paperback with matching covers.

## Douglas Adams - The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy

OK, so this isn't great literature, I include it here for personal reasons as
it brings back some great memories and there are just so many great scenes that
up-turn all the best SF tropes. Copies of the radio shows circulated among my
contemporaries on much copied cassette tapes, and around age 17 I recall taking
a day-trip to London with a friend and both buying copies of one of the newly
released sequel and reading bits out to the each other on the train on the way
home.

__The Complete Trilogy of Five__, paperback with bonus material and a small
"Don't Panic" on the cover.

## Dan Simmons - The Hyperion Cantos

A hugely ambitious masterwork of great depth and emotional power. Brilliantly
plotted and excitingly written, always worth a re-read (or a re-listen as I
enjoyed the audiobooks too.) Also ultimately quite uplifting once you get to
the end.

Four paperbacks, __Hyperion__, __The Fall of Hyperion__, __Endymion__,
__The rise of Endymion__, not even matching sizes, let alone have
related covers. Deeply annoying and very much in need of a sympathetic
re-issue, perhaps with an introduction by Adam Roberts...

## Alasdair Reynolds - The Revelation Space Series

The Revelation Space series is a major achievement - a carefully constructed
and detailed future history strongly rooted in conventional physics (no
warp drives or wormholes here!) and with some well rounded and realised
characters representing the various factions that populate humanty's future.

I wouldn't say it is an easy read - the plots are complex and future that is
portrayed can be a bit bleak (and scary!) but that doesn't take anything
away from the great science fiction that this represents.

My actual favourite is ironically outside the Revelation Space universe, I
have a real soft-spot for __House of Suns__ and its epic scope and scale
but I don't currently have that in physical form.

What I do have to represent this series is actually a mistaken purchase!
Sometime ago I bought an eBook from Google Books titled "The Revelation
Space Collection" and containing five novels and a bunch of short stories
(absolute bargain if I recall...) Anyway, when I saw on Waterstones that
something called "The Revelation Space Collection" was coming out in a
two volume hardback set I pre-ordered it thinking it was the same thing.
Sadly, on arrival it turns out to be just the short stories... Oh well,
they have nice covers at least.

## Frank Herbert - Dune Series

This was another one of my early teenage reads and it blew me away at the
time, I had the thick paperback with the image of Fremen and an ornithopter
on the front and a sand harvester on the back. I also recall going to see
the David Lynch movie in the Leicester Square Odeon and explaining the plot
to my girlfriend at the time and all those around us leaning in to
understand what was going on too.

As that youngster I read __Children of Dune__ and __God Emporer__ but then
moved on to other things. For my recent re-read I finally completed the
second trilogy and have started to read some of the further works
written by his son (which, it has to be said, are not quite as good).

Another triumph of both world building and story in great depth.

They are represented here by the lovely pair of trilogies that were
recently released by Gollanc and look great.
