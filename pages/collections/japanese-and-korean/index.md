Yes, there is a bandwagon here, and yes, I have jumped on it. Japanese and Korean
seem to have exploded onto the UK book scene over the past few years and I have
become hooked on the genre.

I don't recall which book first got me interested but it was probably either
__Before the Coffee Goes Cold__ or __Days at the Morisaki Bookshop__. I'm not
completely sure why this particular genre is attractive to me but I've also
been interested in Japanese culture. The stories themselves are often uplifting
and moving, even if there is little of what we might consider "action", or even
"peril" which can make a nice change from a diet of thrillers and crime novels.
It may be something to do with the translation from the source language but I
often find these books an easy and pleasant read - short clear sentences,
mostly declarative statements and direct speech. There are also typically
insights into Japanese life, culture and (surprisingly often) food, usually
lovingly described. Bookshops and cafes feature _a lot_ (very populare subject
matter for all avid readers!) And perhaps most importantly of all, most of the covers
include a picture of cat!

You will find my current collection listed on the [accompanying page](/collections/japanese-and-korean/shelf-list/)

My favourites so far are those by Satoshi Yagisawa, especially 
__Days at the Torunka Cafe__.

What are your thoughts on these, or any other Japanese and Korean novels? Why
have they become popular in the UK? What your favourites? Let me know in the
comments.
