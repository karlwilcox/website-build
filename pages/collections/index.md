I've always known that I was a reader and had amassed quite a stock of books,
many of which ended up in boxes in the garage. About 10 years ago, with the
rise of electronic devices, and a recognition that I probably wouldn't ever
want to re-read those boxed items I gave away almost my entire stock of
physical books. I even told people that I was going entirely virtual and
would only have a Kindle as that I was all I needed...

Well it turns out that was a load of hooey. In recent years I have realised
that, yes, I love eBooks (especially the low cost of many of them, allowing
me to try something for 99p that I would never have considered as a £10
physical book), and the convenience of carrying so many in a small space
(and reading in bed without disturbing my partner). But I really do like
physical books after all. They are much better for starting conversations
in coffee shops - people will talk to you if they have read, or want to read
the same book you have in hand (that doesn't work with the anonymity of
e-book readers). I like the physicality of opening the book and knowing
how far through I am. And books these days are getting real pretty!

Yes, I have fallen hard for all those marketing gimmicks. And I love
owning and seeing a run of related covers neatly lined up on my self.

So I'm now going to admit that not only am I a book _reader_, I am book
_collector_ and these pages document and list some of my favourite book
collections.
