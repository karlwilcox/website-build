I find reading history interesting (especially if it is history that I have lived through) and also
strangely comforting (you already know the ending!)

I had been doing historical reading in a fairly slapdash way, reading about the cold war, listening to some
Dominic Sandbrook audiobooks in the wrong order that sort of thing, but I decided that I
needed to more methodical and physical so decided to develop a library of books on Modern
British History and then read through them in, as near as possible, proper chronological
order. I also have an odd liking for really thick books so this was an ideal opportunity
to fill some shelf-feet with books with nicely matching spines...

The collection is described in more detail on the [following pages](/collections/modern-british-history/reading-list/)
