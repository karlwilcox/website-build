I had a friend who had amassed an impressive collection of "Magic the Gathering" cards - being an organised
fellow he typed up a list of all the cards, broken down by category. He later admitted he got more pleasure
from having and reading the list than from the cards themselves. Hopefully I won't quite end up there, as I 
do actually want to read all of these, but here's my own list, of the Tolkien section of my bookshelves...

(Some of the categorisation is a bit arbitrary here and you could argue for inclusion elsewhere, but I'm going
with this for now.)
