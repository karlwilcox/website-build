My major contribution to what I have rather grandly named "Computational Heraldry" is the [DrawShield suite of programs](https://drawshield.net), which is hosted on a separate site.

I have worked on some other projects on related heraldic topics which can be found here:

[Textual Analysis of Blazons](/heraldry/corpus-analysis.md)

An unfinished catalog of the heraldry present in Linocln Cathedral (To be uploaded, please contact me if you would like to find out more).
