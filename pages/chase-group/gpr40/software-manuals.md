Once the GPR40 supported remote communications (thanks to me!) there were a
number of applications written to take advantage of this feature. The following
manuals are provided for some of these (with thanks to Spencer B.). I
personally have no knowledge of these programs and am not the copyright holder
of these documents, however I understand that none of these are still available
for commercial sale so I am providing these for information only.

Promotional material for some of these products
