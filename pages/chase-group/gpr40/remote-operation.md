## Background

When I joined Chase Electronics in 1986 the GPR-40 was already in existence,
and it had a very limited ability to output the current signal strength
digitally as a stream of 8 bit ASCII characters. This was very crudely
implemented, both electrically (using +5/0V logic levels) and in the software
(the character output routine set an IO to the appropriate level for the
current bit, then counted to 7 and moved on to the next bit - at a 2MHz clock
speed this equated, very roughly to 9600 baud!) Since mobile computers were
(just!) becoming a thing I was tasked with adding the hardware for a true RS232
interface and the necessary software changes to enable remote operation of all
the functions.

## Hardware Design

I don't recall all the details of this (and it was implemented as a daughter
board in a corner of the CPU board so doesn't appear in the circuit diagrams),
however I think it used a 16450 UART, for which the chip select line is visible
as pin 14 on the address decoder (IC17) in the 
[CPU circuit diagram](/chase-group/gpr40/circuit-diagrams/). There was also a MAX232 which
uses diode charge pumps to create +9/-9V from a +5V supply rail so we could
have proper RS232 signalling.

## Software Implementation

I designed the communication protocol to use only printable ASCII characters
and based it on the pattern used by the Hayes 'AT' commands used in modems of
the day, so it used largely commands based on 2 upper letters followed by an
optional argument. Below is a quick reference listing of the original command
set:

GPR40 Remote Operation Command Set

The receiver would either echo back the command or return requested data on
success, and there was also a small range of error codes, "E1", "E2", etc.

The main data of interest was the signal level, obtained by sending the "SG"
command, however I was aware that after my departure the new developers had
added a facility for the signal level to be sent continuously until interrupted
which allowed a higher sampling rate to be achieved.

The complete set of commands is fully documented from page 55 onwards in the
Will'tek User Guide available as item 6 on the
[Manuals and Flyers page.](/chase-group/gpr40/promotional-material/)

## Demonstration Programs

I was also asked to create some demonstration programs to show off the remote
capabilities and was given (I think, an EPSON PX-8 (
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epson\_PX-8\_Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epson_PX-8_Geneva)
) as this was portable, had a 480 x 64 pixel 8 line display, a built in RS322
port and Microsoft BASIC. Since this whole field was rather new no-one could
tell me what the demo should actually do so I created a few tools myself that
did generate some interest.

I have a couple of screen dumps from the program - these are dated 1986 but
have 25 lines of text and what looks like 320 pixels of width so I'm not sure
what computer they were produced on.

{% include download src="(chase-group/Channel-Occupancy.pdf" desc="Channel Occupancy" %}

This **Channel Occupancy** plot covers a range of frequencies in South London,
including emergency services and private operators, all voice channels The
columns in order show the frequency, percentage of time that a transmission is
in progress and the pattern of usage over a period of about an hour. The bottom
line shows the current time and date, some basic reciever information plus the
current command and response from the GPR40.

{% include download src="/chase-group/gpr40/Frequency-Scan.pdf" desc="Frequency Scan" %}

The Frequency Scan shows a continuous frequency range, in this case 161.75MHz
to 169.25MHz (7.5Mhz in width, at 25KHz channel spacing), so 300 channels
(leaving 20 pixels on the left for the graph scale). The vertical scale is the
signal strength received on each channel. This data would have been captured
over the space of a couple of minutes but the display is interactive in that
you can use the A/D keys to move the full height cursor line which will then
report the precise signal strength at that frequency.

Of course this may all seem a bit trivial these days but it was big thing in 1986!
