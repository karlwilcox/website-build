<p>Once the GPR40 supported remote communications (thanks to me!) there were a number of applications written to take advantage of this feature. The following manuals are provided for some of these (with thanks to Spencer B.). I personally have no knowledge of these programs and am not the copyright holder of these documents, however I understand that none of these are still available for commercial sale so I am providing these for information only.</p>

<p>Promotional material for some of these products<a href="/chase-group/gpr40-software-promotional-materials/"  > can be found on the page here</a>.</p>
