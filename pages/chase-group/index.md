During the 1980's I worked for various members of the Chase Group of Companies
that were originally based in St. Leonards House, near the railway station in
Mortlake, South London.

That is so long ago that the products I worked on are now regarded as "vintage
computing"!

As a service to collectors and anyone interested in vintage computing I am
making available some of the material that I have kept from those days, and
also seeking anything else that can be usefully added to the archive - if you
have any documentation, stories, or even hardware please get in touch via the
contact form at the bottom of this page.
