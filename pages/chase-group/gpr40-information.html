<h2 >Background </h2>

<p>The GPR40 range of interference measuring radio receivers were developed by a British company, Chase Electronics, based (when I joined them at least) in a two storey industrial building, St. Leonards House, close to Mortlake railway station in East Sheen, South London.</p>

<p>The GPR40 was a highly specialised device, each of which was hand built, with a list price of around Â£10,000 in 1986.</p>

<p>At some point the rights to the devices was sold to a German company, Willtek Communications GmbH.</p>

<h2 >Copyright Information</h2>

<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-orange-color">No copyright infringement is intended here.</mark> As far as I am aware all the material copyright remains with the original authors (largely Willtek Communications GmbH, but also RSi of Staines, Middx.). I am providing copies in the hope that they are useful but will comply with any requests by the legitimate copyright holders.</p>

<h2 >Model Numbers</h2>

<p>I am aware of the following models, please use the contact page if you can add any more information to the list!</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 >GPR40.1</h3>

<p>Presumably this existed as at least a prototype but it was before my time</p>

<h3 >GPR40.2 / Willtek 8100</h3>

<p>This is the version that I worked on. At some point the rights appear to have been sold to Willtek GmbH of Ismaning, Germany.</p>

<h2 >Flyers and Manuals</h2>

<p>Promotional material and basic user manuals can be found <a href="/chase-group/gpr40-promotional-materials/"  >on this page.</a></p>

<h2 >Circuit Diagrams</h2>

<p>Schematic diagrams of the electrical circuits can be found on <a href="/chase-group/gpr40-circuit-diagrams/"  >a separate page</a>.</p>

<h2 >Assembly Diagrams</h2>

<p>A partial set of assembly diagrams showing the main physical sections of the reciever <a href="/chase-group/gpr40-assembly-diagrams/"  >can be found here.</a></p>

<h2 >Remote Operation</h2>

<p>It is possible to control all the functions of the GPR 40 over an RS232 serial interface. Full details of this <a href="/chase-group/gpr-40-remote-operation/"  >can be found here</a> (this was my major contribution to the GPR reciever development).</p>

<h2 >Calibration Process</h2>

<p>I was given a complete set of programs to calibrate the receiver but this relies on some equipment (both expensive and old) which I don't have access to. There may be useful information that can be gleaned from reading the program code however. For what it is worth <a href="/chase-group/gpr-40-calibration/"  >all the information can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2 >Associated Software - Promotional Materials</h2>

<p>Software was written to take advantage of the GPR remote comms features, largely involving mapping cellular signal strength. <a href="/chase-group/gpr40-software-promotional-materials/"  >Flyers for these products can be found here.</a></p>

<h2 >Associated Software - User's Manuals</h2>

<p>And the full <a href="/chase-group/gpr40-software-manuals/"  >software user manuals are on this page</a>.</p>
