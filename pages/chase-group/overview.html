<p>During the 1980's I worked for various members of the Chase Group of Companies that were originally based in St. Leonards House, near the railway station in Mortlake, South London.</p>

<p>That is so long ago that the products I worked on are now regarded as "vintage computing"!</p>

<p>As a service to collectors and anyone interested in vintage computing I am making available some of the material that I have kept from those days, and also seeking anything else that can be usefully added to the archive - if you have any documentation, stories, or even hardware please get in touch via the contact form at the bottom of this page.</p>
