<p>The Chase Systems was an innovative but not particularly successful Unix computer system of the mid 1980s.</p>

<p>The innovative part (and hence its name) was the dual processor approach - a Motorola 68000 CPU runs a standard Unix Operating System, while an Intel 80186 co-processor with a custom written "mini" OS provides all the device driver services like hard disk management, serial comms, the real-time clock and so on.</p>
