Secondary School
----------------

I was born in Grimsby, in North East Lincolnshire. My school, _The Western
Comprehensive School_, isn't there anymore - falling numbers rendered it
surplus to requirements and it has been flattened awaiting redevelopment. No
loss architecturally, two storey brick construction with single glazed, metal
framed windows and flat roofs that leaked a lot. Still, it gave me my first
computing experience and ten 'O' levels.

There was no sixth form so I had to move to _The Wintringham School_ to study
random 'A' Levels in Economics, Maths, and Physics, gaining a 'B and two 'C's
respectively. (We tell the young 'uns that things were harder in them days...)
That was sufficient to get me a place at university...

Undergraduate

In 1982 I started at the _University of Kent at Canterbury_, known to us as
"UKC" and now known as "Kent University". I joined the first cohort of students
studying a new degree, Computer Systems Engineering, which combined much of the
Computer Science course with about half the Electronics course, and I was very
pleased to be awarded a II(i) Honours.

We were taught Pascal and the Unix Operating System and I went on to learn the
'C' programming language and the 'vi' editor, whose keystrokes still come
naturally to me some 20 years later. (Somewhat presciently, I had realised the
upcoming importance of keyboard skills and taught myself to touch-type using
borrowed Pitman books and a 1930's vintage "Underwood No. 5" that my father
procured from his work).

The course included a group project lasting several months; our group of four
followed a proposal by Dr. David C. Woods to develop a parser for heraldic
shield descriptions and then displaying the described shield on what was, at
the time, the new and exciting medium of a personal computer! An Apple **\]\[**
to be precise, with twin 80Kb floppy disk drives, one for the program, one for
the UCSD Pascal compiler! Sharp-eyed readers will see some early output taped
to the wall of my room in the accompanying photo. Twenty years later this was
to be the seed of the [Drawshield Suite](/heraldry/) of blazonry programs.

There was also an individual project in the final year; mine was a text
formatter like a simple version of nroff, however it could use a variety of
line breaking algorithms, the most sophisticated of which implemented Donald
Knuth's algorithm from his article "Breaking Paragraphs Into Lines". Some years
later I attended a lecture by the great Professor Knuth and afterwards gave him
a lift to Canterbury railway station. Conveying him safely was probably my
greatest contribution to Computer Science - without my diligent driving _"The
Art of Computer Programming"_ might never have got beyond Volume 3...

Postgraduate
------------

{% include figure caption="Cover of report" src="/about-me/report-cover-258x300.png" align="right" link="/about-me/PhdRep1.pdf" %}

Between 1995 and 1996, with the assistance of my then employer, British
Airways, I started a part-time PHd by Research at the _University of Reading_.
The subject was "Style in Natural Language Generation". The aim of the research
was to automatically generate natural language narratives in a variety of
different styles. This made use of a "generative grammar", which is a recursive
set of rules that can be applied to create grammatical sentences. Example rules
could be _A sentence can be a Noun Phrase followed a Verb Phrase_; _a Noun
Phrase can be a Determiner followed by an Adjective then a Noun_, etc. This
would be used to create all of the possible ways to construct a sentence, and
then a "Neural Network" would be trained to pick out the sentence that most
closely matched the desired style of language.

I completed the first year of work, along with a report and presentation which
was approved for continuing, however a serious family illness prevented further
work. A copy of the first year report is linked from the image here.
