<p>I am an Educator, teaching computer science at all undergraduate levels – more than a thousand students have experienced my teaching and some of them even enjoyed it! I am also a freelance Software Developer, having undertaken many roles in the IT industry, but always coming back to my favourite role of programming. I’ve also developed a good knowledge of heraldry, (which I approached as programming problem!), I’ve dabbled in assorted art media, both digital and physical. I read books and magazine almost constantly and I am deeply envious of those that can speak other languages. As well as continuing to develop the DrawShield website I’m currently re-learning all the electronics that I have forgotten since university.</p>
