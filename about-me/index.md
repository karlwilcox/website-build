I am an Educator, teaching computer science at all undergraduate levels – more
than a thousand students have experienced my teaching and some of them even
enjoyed it! I am also a freelance Software Developer, having undertaken many
roles in the IT industry, but always coming back to my favourite role of
programming. I’ve also developed a good knowledge of heraldry, (which I
approached as programming problem!), I’ve dabbled in assorted art media, both
digital and physical. I read books and magazine almost constantly and I am
deeply envious of those that can speak other languages. As well as continuing
to develop the DrawShield website I’m currently re-learning all the electronics
that I have forgotten since university.
