## Heraldry

I created the [drawshield.net](https://drawshield.net) website. And it is pretty darn
good, if you define "good" as being able to create heraldic shields by typing in
the "blazon" - the description of the shield in a special language. It represents
over ten years of sporadic development and many contributions from helpful
folks I have met along the way, to whom I am very grateful.

## Juggling

I can juggle. I mean, like, really badly and inconsistently but I can manage
several different patterns of three balls, often for
minutes at a time and have in the past also managed patterns of
three clubs (surprisingly relaxing and ryhtymic) and four balls, two in
each hand. I'd really like to master the cascade of five...

## Dabbling With Technologies

At various times, for various reasons I have dabbled with various technologies:

* Written themes and plug-ins for WordPress
* Written plug-ins for Blender
* Created some over-complicated Excel spreadsheets
  * For timing multiple, simultaneous exams
  * For tracking multiple, repeating tasks

## Graphic Design

At times I have also fancied myself as a graphic designer (after all, how difficult
can it be?). You can see some of the results here:
