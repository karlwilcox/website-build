This was another module specifically developed for the IT degree programme
([see the COTS page for more information](/cs-teaching/csocsc/) about this degree).

Obviously a follow-on from [Software Engineering I](/cs-teaching/cs1tq2/) using
the same course book but with added content about career management and job
guidance.

## Exam Questions

These are an example set of exam questions and answers. Sadly they are password protected and,
unsurprisingly after more than 20 years I can't remember what it is. The encryption isn't very
strong and can easily be broken with the right tools so you are welcome to download these and
have a go - it will be the same password for all files.
