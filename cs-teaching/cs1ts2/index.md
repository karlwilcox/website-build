This was another module specifically developed for the IT degree programme
([see the COTS page for more information](/cs-teaching/csocsc/) about this degree).

It was a fairly conventional SE module, using Ian Sommervilles book, at the time in
its sixth edition, although I didn't use all the chapters and re-arranged the
topics to suit what I thought was a more useful order. I also tried to bring in
a lot of my practical experience, especially in the seminars where we did a lot
of role play and used examples and data taken from my previous work in the IT
industry.

## Exam Questions

These are an example set of exam questions and answers. Sadly they are password protected and,
unsurprisingly after more than 20 years I can't remember what it is. The encryption isn't very
strong and can easily be broken with the right tools so you are welcome to download these and
have a go - it will be the same password for all files.
