This was an interesting module and one that had to be created entirely from scratch as there was
no course book or existing material to work from. It was part of a new initiative at Reading,
the IT Degree Programme. Reading University already had a Computer Science degree but it was
very traditional - Compiling Techniques, Algorithm Design, Operating Systems Theory and was
quite "math heavy" in places. The intention of the IT Degree was that it would concentrate much
more on *how* technology was used and be much more widely applicable. The Commercial Off-the-Shelf
Software module was one of the flagship modules for this programme.

The aim of the module was to introduce students to the selection and use of bought-in software
and understand the choices and trade-offs that need to be made. There was a strong practical
element and a programming component in learning to develop solutions in MicroSoft VBA (Visual
Basic for Applications).

Initially the aim was for all students to take a third party qualification known as the
"European Computer Driving Licence" (yes, I hated the name too...) and that this would
comprise 10% of the final grade, however fairly late in the day the academic board said that
we couldn't do this as there was no route of appeal. Hence you will see a lot of mentions of
ECDL, especially in the practial work but the decision to take the test was left up to the
students themselves.

The module was actually open to students on any module and somehow word got around that this
was going to be quite an "easy" module so the numbers enrolled were quite high and I think
we had to split the lab sessions into two groups to fit them all in. I have no idea how the
rumor came about because I wrote the material as I went along soa there was not much to go
on! Perhaps it was infered from the module description below!

## Exam Questions and Model Answers

These are an example set of exam questions and answers. Sadly they are password protected and,
unsurprisingly after more than 20 years I can't remember what it is. The encryption isn't very
strong and can easily be broken with the right tools so you are welcome to download these and
have a go - it will be the same password for all files.
