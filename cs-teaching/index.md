## Historical Teaching Materials

I’ve taught various computing modules at undergraduate level at several
institutions. I’m presenting here some of the teaching materials as an example
of the history of Computer Science education. None of the modules are still
being taught so I’m not revealing any secrets here but I hope that they might
one day prove useful, if nothing else just to show how fast the pace of
technology development is moving and how much updating needs to be done to keep
computer science education relevant.

You can find a list of the modules in the sidebar menu.
