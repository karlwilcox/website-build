## Historical Teaching Materials

I’ve taught various computing modules at undergraduate level at several
institutions. I’m presenting here some of the teaching materials as an example
of the history of Computer Science education. None of the modules are still
being taught so I’m not revealing any secrets here but they did entail
quite a lot of work in their creation and I hope that they might
one day prove useful, if nothing else just to show how fast the pace of
technology development is moving and how much updating needs to be done to keep
computer science education relevant.

You can find a list of the modules in the sidebar menu.

I'm also including here a presentation that I was asked to make on the state
of the Software Engineering Industry for a promotion interview, I think this
would have been 2001 (so apologies for the rather garish template!).
