This was a second year module which, to be honest, I felt was a bit
old-fashioned even at the time (I've never been convinced that paging
algorithms are all that useful to the average working programmer). Nevertheless
that's what I was paid to teach but I did try to add value to the subject by
drawing parallels with other areas of Computer Science that might benefit from
similar techniques.

I have all of the presentation materials here, the practical work and some
example exam questions and model answers.
