Reading, like many teaching institutions has a set of entry requirements for its
undergraduate degree programmes, typically for UK students these are 'A' levels or
HND equivalents. For overseas students there are a number of qualifications that
are also recognised but many other qualifications are not recognised (I think this
was from a list maintained by what was at the time known as the Higher Education
Funding Council for England - HEFCE?). Anyway, for those students who didn't
have suitable pre-conditions the university ran a one year foundation programme
which gave students a Diploma which equated to 3 'A' levels.

One of the modules for this Foundation Year programme was in Computer
Science, and I was engaged to teach this module in 2002. It was intended to just
provide a basic familiarity with computing topics and to teach the rudiments of
programming using Pascal (specifically Turbo Pascal on Windows PCs).

I enjoyed teaching this - unsurprisingly the students came from a *very* range
of backgrounds and countries, and had a very range of pre-existing skills, so it
was something of challenge to herd them all in the same direction and to the
appropriate level of achievement!
