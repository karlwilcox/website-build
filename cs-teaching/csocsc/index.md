## Exam Questions and Model Answers

These are an example set of exam questions and answers. Sadly they are password protected and,
unsurprisingly after more than 20 years I can't remember what it is. The encryption isn't very
strong and can easily be broken with the right tools so you are welcome to download these and
have a go - it will be the same password for all files.
