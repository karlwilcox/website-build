This wasn't my module, it was actually taught by someone else but my boss
arranged for that someone else to teach formal methods (which I didn't
know very much about) to some of my students while I taught UML (which
I didn't know much about either) to his Design Methodologies students.

Fortunately I did know a lot about [Flight Planning](/blog/flight-planning-1999)
and had lifted some UML diagrams from a previous employer so I talked about
that instead.

I have all of the presentation materials here.
