    When I tag something with 'Recommended' I believe that you will really enjoy
    and get something out of this! It likely represents the peak of the genre
    of the very best of a particular author or studio, at least in my view.
- tag: "interesting"
  type: "secondary"
  text: "Interesting"
  longtext: "Interesting Works"
  description: >
    To gain an 'Interesting' tag a work needs to be a bit different, to try
    something new or be surprising in some way. It isn't necessarily "great"
    but it may well reward your time in unexpected ways.
- tag: "avoid"
  type: "alert"
  text: "Avoid"
  longtext: "Works to Avoid(?)"

    The tag 'Avoid' doesn't necessarily represent something that is intrinsically bad.
    Things end up here because, for whatever reason, I'm disappointed in them, didn't
    enjoy it as much as I hoped or was plain frustrated by it. Your opinion may
    well differ but don't let it be said that you weren't at least forewarned.
