2025,Feb,,"Towards Zero",tvshow,BBC?,"An obscure Agatha Christie story. Nicely acted in a beautiful period setting (1930's). The actors took it all seriously but I just didn't buy a single aspect of it, from the unlikely locations to the actual events, nothing is really believable but it is harmless fun and an easy watch."
