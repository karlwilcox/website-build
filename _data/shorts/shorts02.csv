2025,Feb,,"Towards Zero",tvshow,BBC?,"An obscure Agatha Christie story. Nicely acted in a beautiful period setting (1930's). The actors took it all seriously but I just didn't buy a single aspect of it, from the unlikely locations to the actual events, nothing is really believable but it is harmless fun and an easy watch."
2025,Apr,,"Life List",movie,Netflix,"(Abandoned) Almost good story of a doting mother's instructions to a daughter to complete the life list she made at 13 years of age. Interesting premise but ultimately and unengaging story of beautiful, privileged people and their very first-world problems of affluence. Everyone is just too perfect!"
2025,Apr,,Greedy People,movie,Sky Atlantic,"Crime comedy with two cops and their attempts to cover up an accidental shooting. Very dark, a bit gory but also surprisingly funny. Better than I expected with some good twists."
2025,Apr,The,Critic,movie,Amazon Prime,"Ian McKellan as a particularly unlikeable theatre critic and his professional (and unprofessional relationship with a young actresss. Lovely period scenes and well acted all round, but not a particularly edifying or uplifting spectacle!"
2025,May,,Say Nothing,tvshow,Disney+,"Based on the troubles in Northern Ireland. Quite compelling (and eye-opening) with some very gruesome scenes. Not afraid to pull punches but just became too nasty for me to see through to the end."
2025,May,The,Essex Millionaire Murders,tvshow,ITV?,"I have to say that no-one came out of this well, yes the murderer was a deeply manipulative and unpleasant person but then all those around him didn't seem that nice either! Not exactly uplifting viewing..."
2025,May,,Another Simple Favour,movie,Sky Cinema?,"Deeply silly if rather pretty sequel to a movie I have apparantly seen but recall nothing about (this is why I've started journalling everything!)> There's a mafia wedding, lots of double dealing and unlikely twists but it is quite fun and entertaining in a mindless way."
2025,Jan,,Kinda Pregnant,movie,Netflix,"Clearly written by someone who has experienced both the highs and lows of pregnancy themselves, this is a lighthearted romcom that you really can't take too seriously but will laugh all the way through anyway."
2025,Apr,The,Problem With People,movie,Amazon Prime,"A harmless piece of blarney about a long estranged family and the impact of a ill-thought out will. Include Chief O'Brien and Jimmy Perez's girlfriend amongst other familiar faces in a light-hearted comedy that did make me smile."
2025,Jan,The,Breakthrough,tvshow,Netflix,"Swedish police procedural with a long cold case solved by a famalial geneaologist using DMA samples. If it wasn't true you probably wouldn't believe! But worth a watch"
2025,Jan,,An-Eliach (The Island),tvshow,BBC iPlayer,"Groundbreaking gaelic drama but pretty standard fare, locked room murder on the local laird. Abandoned for now but might pick up again one day"
2025,Jan,,Back in Action,movie,Netflix,"Huge helpings of stupid, lashings of wooden acting, easily confused with 'The Family Plan' (pretty much the same plot) but relieved by some cracking repartee and Glenn Close having a great time"
2025,Jan,,After the Flood,tvshow,ITV Player,"(Abandoned) The main character seems to delight in making things difficult for herself so doesn't get my sympathy and the whole DNA links from a geneaology site is just way too easy, there are no safeguards at all! I just can't buy into this premise."
2025,Feb,,Toxic Town,tvshow,BBC,"A good, if not groundbreaking drama about the Corby redevelopment in the 1980s. It hit all the right notes and dramatic beats. Well acted but perhaps a bit simplified and overly signposted."
2025,May,,Echo Valley,movie,"Apple TV+",”Cleverly plotted if rather bleak story of how far a mother (Julianne Moore) will go to protect her daughter (Sydney Sweeney) and dig her out of a massive hole of her own making. Well acted but not not exactly exactly a fun watch“
2025,May,,Farscape,tvshow,Netflix,” I just watched the first episode out of historical curiosity and it was actually much much better than I expected. It doesn’t even appear very dated and maybe one day I’ll watch the rest of the series.”
2025,Jun,,Stick,tvshow,Apple TV+,”Owen Wilson plays himself as a washed up golfer finding a protégé. I’m training him up for even greatest success. Well acted, especially by the Prodigy‘s mum but abandoned for now as I’m just not that interested in golf. Maybe some other time.”
