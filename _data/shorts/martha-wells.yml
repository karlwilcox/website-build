    The good thing about novellas is that you can read them in a day or so!
    Although sold (and sometimes priced) as novels some of the murderbot series
    are quite short and this is no exception. It tells a fairly straightforward
    tale of our hero invesitigating the massacre buried in his memory and helping
    out a group of humans to retrieve some research stolen from them, along the 
    way meeting up with a powerful (and helpful) ship AI. Good insights into the
    human condition and a fun little, undemanding read.
