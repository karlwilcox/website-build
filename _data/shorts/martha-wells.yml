    The good thing about novellas is that you can read them in a day or so!
    Although sold (and sometimes priced) as novels some of the murderbot series
    are quite short and this is no exception. It tells a fairly straightforward
    tale of our hero invesitigating the massacre buried in his memory and helping
    out a group of humans to retrieve some research stolen from them, along the 
    way meeting up with a powerful (and helpful) ship AI. Good insights into the
    human condition and a fun little, undemanding read.

    Another short but fun read. It's largely a brawl on an abandoned terra-forming
    platform but the premise is set up quite neatly, along with the unwanted but
    ultimately successfully discharged responsibility to keep yet another group
    of random humans safe from harm. A neat ending and a clever set up for the
    ongoing story linking us back to the first book. Clever and fun.

    A nice little novella (reading them in in-universe order), a fun diversion for
    an hour or two. Fairly low stakes and more human involvement (our hero
    reluctantly agrees to help the Station Security folks investigate a murder and
    gradually wins their trust). A useful addition to the series.
