    Spanish language production nicely dubbed into English. Story of two young
    children caught up with feuding Jewish/Mexican business families and
    abducted, somewhat reluctantly by their father and pursued on a global
    trotting trip by their mother. If it wasn't based on a true story you
    probably wouldn't believe it! But the clothes are lovely to look at.
