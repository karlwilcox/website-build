2022,Apr,,Lightyear,movie,Disney+,This was too long and really dragged in the middle but did get better eventually. The best joke had been spoilered in the trailer and Sox was the stand-out star!
2022,Apr,,Broadlands,book,David Blake,"Norfolk Broads set police procedural. A workman-like story with nothing to really stand out with in this rather crowded genre, and the ""romance"" between the lead characters was just cringey."
2022,May,The,Dropout,movie,Disney+,The astonishing tale of the blood testing company Theranos with a great performance by Jennifer Lawrence. Convincingly acted and totally gripping - surprisingly tense at times.
2022,Jun,,Bad Blood,book,John Carreyrou,inspired by watching the above to read the source book you find that the real story is even more complicated than the TV show and extra details make this a worthwhile read.
2024,Jan,,Freelance,movie,Netflix,"You can tell from the promo image that this would be a load of nonsense but it was harmless nonsense and didn't take itself too seriously, although it did kind of overcook all the gun battles to the point of stupidity..."
2024,Jan,,About My Father,movie,Sky Cinema,"Robert de Niro talking Italian (""... italian..."") Just the right side of being cringey (but only just) and there were some funny scenes, but most characters had barely one dimension let alone two!"
2024,Jan,The,Creator,movie,Disney+,(Unfinished) A lovely vintage montage at the start but everything else seemed cliched and derivative - way to go on the 2D characterization there. I'm sure that there will be redemption and growth along the way but I'm not willing to spend another 2 or 3 hours to find out!
2024,Feb,,Criminal Record,tvshow,Apple TV+," This really draws you in, a very compelling story. Peter Capaldi was great and the acting all round was top notch. Story about a possibly corrupt cop and a rookie investigating a series of possibly linked crimes. Cleverly written"
2024,Feb,,Silver and the Book of Dreams,movie,Prime TV,"TV Fantasy about dreams becoming real and shared. A strange and unusual film-visual and hyper-real, dreamlike but also grounded. Well worth watching."
2024,Feb,,Guardians of the Galaxy 3,movie,Disney+,"(Unfinished) Abandoned this after a while. It looks great, clearly lots of money spent on it but I just couldn't get into this enough to care about any of the characters to watch it until the end."
2024,Feb,The Great Courses:,History of English,audio,Audible,Professor Michael Drout. I'm not sure that I learned too much I didn't already know but the good professor is always great to listen to!
2024,Mar,,In Ascension,book,Martin MacInnes,"This was hypnotic and lyrical with convincing female characters. The story itself dragged a little towards the end, which itself was rather sudden. We follow a marine biologist down into the investigation of strange, -at least as far as one male reader can comment on the work of a male writer possibly extraterrestrial origin. In reality I think the plot was more of a framework to investigate the relationship between the main character and her mother and sister. SF with a side order of relationship stories."
2024,Mar,,Halo,movie,Paramount+,"(abandoned) I've tried to watch this twice now and given up after a couple of episodes. Partly because I can't seem to get subtitles on this series and quite a few of the characters( including Master Chief himself) mumble a lot and I couldn't hear them, but on the whole it just didn't hold my attention. Shame, because I'm probably missing out here."
2024,Mar,,Jesus Revolution,movie,Sky Cinema,"I mostly enjoyed this but I wasn't always sure where it was going. The story of an older preacher and a younger, spiritual man working to reach hippies in the face of opposition from the church authorities. It was an interesting story, well told but I wouldn't want to watch it again "
2024,Mar,,Jules,movie,Sky Cinema,"A very sweet and funny movie about a stranded alien (shades of ET) and a curmudgeonly old guy( shades of Night sky) that takes some unexpected turns. Beautifully acted, high stake, but not too stressful (or too long!) this is a film that does make you think."
2024,Mar,,No Hard Feelings,movie,Sky Cinema,lightly creepy story about an older woman and a young boy but funny enough to get over it. Jennifer Lawrence wanted to play against type perhaps? And I did like the setting so fun overall.
2023,Jan,,Welcome to Chippendales,tvshow,Disney+,"all new to me, fascinating story, well told; couldn't help noticing similarity between the main character here and his counterpart in ""The Dropout""."
2023,Jan,,Shotgun Wedding,movie,Prime TV,daft but fun harmless popcorn movie lifted above the ordinary by Jennifer Coolidge and Lennie Kravitz(!)
2023,Feb,,Lady Chatterly's Lover (2022),movie,Netflix,"nicely done, believable and well acted. enjoyed this."
2023,Mar,,Bank of Dave,movie,Netflix,"Corny, simplistic, emotionally manipulative, and takes huge liberties with the true story, but I absolutely loved this!"
2023,Mar,,Father Stu,movie,Sky Cinema,"interesting story, well acted but accent was almost unintelligible (and nothing like the real priest, according to the clips at the end!)"
2022,Jan,,Being the Ricardos,movie,Prime TV,"I did enjoy this, very authentic to look at, well acted but I did lose the thread of things at times."
2022,Jan,,Greyhound,movie,Apple TV+,"Tom Hanks captaining a destroyer guarding an Atlantic convoy. Well acted by all, the helmet worn by the radio operator was historically authentic but did make him look like Dark Helmet from 'Spaceballs'; and the taunting chat with the submarine was most certainly NOT historically authentic and actually quite silly."
2022,Jan,,Finch,movie,Apple TV+,"More Tom Hanks but accompanied only by his dog and a robot (wonder if Covid restrictions had any part to play here...?) in a post-apocalyptic future. Surprisingly moving, made you cry over a dumb robot."
2022,Jan,,Power of the Dog,movie,Netflix,"Powerful film, a very cleverly told story about 1910s(/) cowboy life, not a period often portrayed. Well acted, probably deserving of its awards but not something I would particularly want to watch again."
2022,Feb,,Red Notice,movie,Netflix,Totally daft action movie that doesn't really take anything too seriously and is all the better for it.
2022,Feb,,French Exit,movie,Sky Cinema,good concept with funny and unexpected moments but far too long on the atmospheric lingering shots
2022,Feb,,Constellation,tvshow,Apple TV+,(abandoned) Usual high quality Apple production about a returning astronaut but it just didn't grab me( and there was a disturbing scene involving Jelly cat bunny and I just couldn't take anymore!
2022,Mar,The,Adam Project,movie,Netflix,"fun movie, Ryan Reynolds rarely makes a bad choice of role and plays this one well, but I did feel that tedious and unnecessary action scenes made the film longer than it needed to be"
2022,Mar,,OMNO,game,Xbox,"(abandoned) This was an open world puzzler that looked absolutely beautiful and was a delight to move around. The puzzles were satisfying, not overly complex but challenging enough to be interested, however I just gave  up when I had figured out what was needed to solve a puzzle but that the actual execution required stupidly accurate button-mashing that my arthritic fingers just couldn't do!"
2022,Mar,The,Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard,movie,Sky Cinema,"fast paced fun and funny but leave your credibility at home! At least it doesn't take itself seriously, and the ""hints"" scene about where our hero should go next was a knowing (and funny) nod to unlikely coincidences in the movies."
2022,Mar,,Wolf Like Me,tvshow,Sky TV,Another modern update on the werewolf theme with some clever use of the standard tropes in a fairly simple story that was pleasingly told. Whether that is enough to get me demanding a second season I'm not so sure.
2022,Mar,,Our Ladies,movie,Sky Cinema,"Story of a religious Girl's School trip to a choir contest in the big city. Slightly aimless but entertaining, not a great advertisement for Scottish men"
2022,Mar,,Your Place or Mine,movie,Netflix,"A hopelessly unrealistic movie with a deeply unlikely premise about privileged white people that we really should dislike, but if you suspend the disbelief and accept that the world really is as clean as it looks here then this can be a good way to pass your time. There was something about house swapping, or possibly life swapping but everything looks very nice and the ending could be considered a tear-jerker if you were feeling particularly sentimental that day..."
2022,Nov,,Elvis,movie,Sky Store,"Interesting story, annoying in-your-face editing, and way too much mumbling to follow what was going on without subtitles. But it has inspired me to buy an Elvis biography... (later: but not actually finish reading it)"
2022,Nov,The,Phantom of the Open,movie,Sky Cinema,tour-def-force acting by Mark Rylance in a enjoyable caper - the sort of movie that seems to be coming something of a British cinema staple. Concerns a (very) mediocre golfer bluffing and blagging his way into the British Open
2022,Dec,The,Duke,movie,Sky Cinema,"great fun, clever cinematography and an BAFTA worthy performance from Jim Broadbent telling the story of the theft of a painting. apparently a bizarre but true story"
2022,Apr,The,Eyes of Tammy Faye,movie,Sky Cinema,Bio-pic about the wife of a US television evangelist. A well acted movie and a really intriguing story but not something I could watch again
2022,Apr,,Spencer,movie,Sky Cinema,"A slice of the life of Diana, Princess of Wales. A tour-de-force of the film makers art (the techniques could fill a fair few media studies lectures) but not really a particularly interesting story and overall not a great piece of actual entertainment."
2022,May,,Death on the Nile (2022),movie,Sky Cinema,"Beautifully filmed, intricately plotted and quite fun - indeed so complicated that I would probably enjoy watching this a second time just as much!"
2022,May,,Pieces of Her,tvshow,Netflix,"A Netflix show staring Toni Collette (who seems to be everywhere these days!) She witnesses a violent crime that kicks her mother into equally violent action and opens a family can of worms. This was quite a complex story, but enjoyable, really only being let down by the totally unconvincing setting - supposedly Georgia in the US but obviously Australia! Why not just change the setting!"
2022,Jun,A,Short History of Europe,book,Simon Jenkins,Listened to as an audiobook - well written engaging history but ultimately I just felt rather sad.
2022,Jun,,Anatomy of a Scandal,tvshow,Netflix,"A Netflix show about a British MP and secrets from the past. Compelling drama, well acted but I had trouble telling the young versions of the characters apart as they all looked the same to me!"
2022,Jun,,Turning Red,movie,Disney+,"I found this passably entertaining, but there was less for adults than usual for Pixar, which is not to say it was bad, just that I didn't really relate to anyone. As always, great animation though."
2022,Sep,,Unlawful Killing,book,Her Honour Wendy Joseph QC,"A very important book, an insightful, compassionate look at the role of a high court judge and our judicial system in general. Crying out for a second volume. This should be more widely read."
2022,Oct,,Five Days at Memorial,tvshow,Apple TV+,"The story of hospital cut off by hurricane Katrina. A clever, rather harrowing piece of TV that gave all views equal weight (well, except the evil, uncaring corporation angle). Maybe an episode too long as I nearly gave up after 4…"
2022,Oct,The,Cult of We – WeWork and the Great Start-up Delusion,book,Eliot Brown & Maureen Farrell,An interesting and well written cautionary tale about the rise and fall of WeWork. Although I see no evidence that anyone has learned anything from this episode and expect it to happen again an again…
2022,Nov,,Bad Sisters,tvshow,Apple TV+,Obviously made with the full cooperation of the Irish Tourist Board (although the is the “40 foot” really the best thing in Dublin?) A clever idea but way too long. I watched episodes 1 to 5 and 10 and didn’t feel that I had missed out…
2022,Nov,The,Lost City,movie,Paramount+,"Who doesn’t love Sandra Bullock, especially in a film that doesn’t take itself remotely seriously and in which everyone clearly had a great time making (especially Daniel Radcliffe). Great fun, seen it twice enjoyed it both times."
2022,Nov,,Belfast,movie,Sky Cinema,"A surprsingly charming, moving and brilliantly acted film, enjoyed this more than expected"
2022,Dec,,Why We Get the Wrong Politicians,book,Isabel Hardman,"Interesting and well written book but frustrating in the story it reveals. Part of the aim was to encourage more participation in politics but it just repelled me further I'm afraid."
2022,Jul,,Kind Richard,movie,Sky Cinema,"I didn't expect to like this as I'm not that interested in tennis but this story of a stubborn man and his talented daughters was surprsingly gripping"
2022,Jul,,House of Gucci,movie,Sky Cinema,"A fascinating, long but ultimately rather sad tale of everyday Italian rich folk and the problems that a lack of communication can bring"
2022,Jul,A,History of Britain - Volume 1,book,Simon Schama,"Listened to as an audiobook which works well as Simon has a great turn of phrase and uses it to good effect telling the complicated story here"
2022,Dec,The,Idea Factory - Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation,book,Jon Gertner,"As always, I want more technical detail and less personality but that's just me (and I guess I can always consult the Bell Labs Journal in the library) but even so this was a great read, and thought provoking. Recommended."
2022,Jun,The,Essex Serpent,tvshow,Apple TV,"Historically convincing drama about strange goings on in the Essex marches. Reminded me of 'Howard's End', if these characters could only connect things would be so much easier for them!"
2022,Jun,The,Staircase,tvshow,Netflix,"The ubiquitous Toni Collette falls down stairs lots and lots of times in this confusing true-life story which this show manages to make even more so."
2023,Jan,The,Murders at Fleat House,book,Lucinda Riley,"Published posthumously to cash in on the success of the seven sisters book this is a competent police procedural with slightly thin characters but enjoyable enough. Without the name recognition I doubt this would have been as popular on itw own merits."
2024,Apr,,Palmer,movie,Apple TV,"No film can truly move you if you don't care about the characters.- and this films succeeds because we do care. There are no black or white heroes and villains here, just plain folk trying to do their best and not necessarily making good life choices around kids and jobs. Good acting and on intersting and moving story."
2023,Jan,The,Keeper of Lost Causes,book,Jussi Adler-Olsen,"Danish based crime drama (inevitably a bit noir). A great story, well told but just a bit too gorily graphic in some of the scenes with Merette"
2022,Aug,,Persuasion (2022),movie,Netflix,"Initially this was just escapist fun but by the two hour mark I was screaming for the leads to finally get it together!"
2022,Aug,,Luck,movie,Apple TV,"Visually reminiscent of 'Robots' but tries too hard to be cute and meaningful so the story ended up feeling rather strained and not actually fun."
2022,Aug,,Thirteen Lives,movie,Netflix,"We all know that the 13 boys trapped in the cave made it out but this still ends up very tense. An incredible story turned in to an outstanding movie!"
2022,Sep,,Toy Story 4,movie,Disney+,"A film I was actually in ignorance of, and was happier that way. It was easy to lose track of the plot and they forgot to make it funny but the animation was high quality."
2022,Sep,The,Life of an MP,book,Jess Phillips,"This was engaging and enterraining but still fails to convince me that I want to have anything to do with politics if I can possibly help it."
2024,Jul,,Botany Manor,game,XBox,"Looks good, like the motion sickness reduction options, lack of time pressure, maps and a straightfoward first puzzle. Unfortunately I'm still stuck on the second one!"
2023,Apr,The,Great Courses: History and Archaeology of the Bible,draft,Audible,"(audio) Jean-Pierre Isbouts"
2023,May,The Great Courses: The,Historical Jesus,audio,Audible,"Bart D, Erhman - I was expecting something about archeology and historical evidence but this was really asking how much of Bible canon can be regarded as genuinely historical, although it did also include coverage of contemporaneous documents as well.. I did find this interesting and the accompanying notes are very thorough this has been a worthwhile course g lectures to listen to."

2023,Nov,,Ahsoka,tvshow,Disney+,"Ok, so a Star Wars show can hardly be anything but derivative since it has to fit in with so much established canon so it can be hard to bring something new and fresh to the genre. Exhibit A is this show I'm afraid. I've given up about halfway through and I understnand that the studio has too..."
2024,Jun,,British Rail,book,Christian Wolmar,"An easy read about an interesting subject. clearly the author has a well known agenda here but doesn't let it intrude too much on a fairly straight forward history-Good but not great."
2024,May,,Turtles All the Way Down,movie,Sky Cinema,"A sweet film about a girl with OCD and her best friend. Well acted, everyone in nice clothes and American high school kids that actually seemed to be nice to each other! The billionaires son role in the story line was a bit improbable but get over that and there's quite a lot to like. It tells the OCD story well and has realistic, rounded characters with flaws and strengths."
2024,Jul,The,Acolyte,tvshow,Disney+,"(Abandoned) Looks good, but just couldn't get involved with the characters to spend more time with it, sorry. Second season cancelled anyway!"
none,any,,Cowboy Bebop,tvshow,Netflix,"I came to this without prior knowledge of previous incarnations so I really enjoyed it on its own merits. I loved the characters and the story was good and there was lots of actual fun to be had watching so I was disappointed that it was cancelled. Yah boo Netflix!"
2024,May,The Great Courses: The,History of the Bible: The Making of New Testament Canon,audio,Bart D. Erhman,"Very focussed on the title topic but interesting and engaging delivery. I learned a lot about the timline of events, the books and the creation of accepted canon. A good listen"
2024,May,The Modern Scholar:,From Jesus to Christianity - A history of the Early Church,audio,Thomas F. Madden,"This was potentially really interesting but I've had to listen to the whole thing at least twice as the delivery was so flat that I kept  drifting off. Good material but poor presentation."
2024,Jun,,Rebus,tvshow,ITV+,"Is there ever a detective without a dark past and a major hang up? This was pretty grim around really, well written and acted and all that but you feel a bit grubby from watching and its not exactly an uplifting experience so not for me."
2024,Jul,,Yellowstone,tvshow,Paramount+,"This is a really impressive piece of television with great characters and an intriguing premise. But rather like the Yellowstone ranch itself this just seems to be too big to swallow! Four seasons, of hour long shows and two prequels shows. I'm not sure how much of this I can actually take on..."
2024,Apr,,Ferrari,movie,Sky Cinema,"An intriguing bio-pic of Enzo Ferrari. It was well acted by all concerned and the Italian sunshine looked lovely, although the mumbled Italian accents were less welcome and hard to understand at times.  Equally baffling were the (over-long) racing scenes, never quite sure who was who and where they all were. Wacky Races did this better...  However I felt the movie was marred by the completely unnecessary and horribly graphic scenes of the accident site. The accident itself was shocking enough without needing lingering shots of body parts. I guess the film makers wanted to understand the shock and peril that Enzo was in as the people looked for answers but the whole court case and its peril just went away with a line or two of dialogue. Not needed."
2024,Aug,,Gran Turismo,movie,Sky cinema,"Abandoned soon after starting. Lots of rather dull races and I cant really see the point of spending 2+ hours watching this!"
2024,Apr,"The Great Courses: The",Life and Works of Jane Austen,audio,Audible,"Devoney Looser. Interesting and lively lecture series by a great presenter with a cool name. I would recommend this and intend to listen to it myself again."
2024,Apr,,One Summer in Paris,book,Sarah Morgan,"Comfort reading and better for it! Easy, fast moving stores, although the characters seem to have swapped age appropriate names and Grace has a supernatural ability to locate Audrey based on the smallest of clues-but at least it keeps the plot moving along. A book to cuddle up at any time of the year."
2024,Oct,,Wolfs,movie,Apple TV+,"An interesting premise but quite a lot of padding for a really quite short film - the long chase on foot was just tedious and all the slow-mo was clearly just filler. Funny in parts, the leads are great but it just needed more actual story."
2024,Nov,,Ufologists,movie,Amazon Prime,"Multi-award winning comedy fails to fly. I assume that the premise was 'lets make a mock documentary about Ufologists in Cornwall but play it absolutely straight - because UFO nuts are just funny anyway, right?' No. Sad verging on cruel and definitely not funny"
2024,Nov,,Moonflower Murders S1,tvshow,BBC iPlayer,"(Abandoned) Tries way too hard. People love cosy murder mysteries and costume drama, lets do both at once using modern day as a frame narrative for a fictional murder, but here's the gimmick, we'll use the same actors, go to be great right? No. Stereotyped and rather staid. Not for me."
2024,Dec,,Joy - the Birth of IVF,movie,Amazon Prime,"This was a loving recreation of the 1970's, cars, haircuts and all, along with a really well told story of the first artificial insemination. Great acting, an important story, well done to all concerned."
2024,Dec,,Dr Who 2024 Christmas Special,tvshow,BBC iPlayer,"This was great, a lot of story packed in, never dull and surprisingly reflective (of the doctor). Both female supports were great, I loved the Mr Benn reference and it was a happy ending allround. Merry Christmas one and all!"
