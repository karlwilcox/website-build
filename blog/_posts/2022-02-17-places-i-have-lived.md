My wife asked me this, so I made a list...

*   Grimsby, Lincolnshire
*   Grimsby, Lincolnshire
*   Canterbury, Kent
*   Whitstable, Kent
*   Canterbury, Kent
*   Canterbury, Kent
*   East Sheen, London
*   Letchworth, Herts
*   Bracknell, Berks
*   Basingstoke, Hants
*   (Stevenage, Herts)
*   Basingstoke, Hants,
*   Bracknell, Berks
*   Bracknell, Berks
*   Near Lincoln, Lincolnshire

I have defined "lived" as meaning having a formal address at which I could be contacted for an extended period of time. Stevenage is in brackets
because I owned a house there and so was "contactable" via that address but for work related reasons never actually lived in it.

I lived for 18 years in the second place, and have been at the current place for almost 20 years
