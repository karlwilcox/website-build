Being a bit frazzled from a long day I just wanted to chill for a bit so I turned to the streaming services
to catch up on some shows. Starting with Andor, season 2.

Right from the outset it is clear from our recall of the previous season and the
quality of the story-telling what is going on and what is at stake. If Cassian can't get that
stolen fighter out of the hangar then bad things will happen. Over the episode we follow four
separate story lines but we understand the motivations and purposes of everyone involved.

Even though we are in a Science Fiction setting (in a galaxy a long way away and a long time ago
remember) we clearly understand how everything works and what the limitations are. Especially
since we don't have any of that silly Jedi stuff here, what we have is ordinary people with
all their strengths and faults. They are ambitious, motivated, selfish, worried, scared,
heroic or sometimes just a bit stupid. 

And the technology is understood, it might be advanced but we still know that if you want to
travel somewhere then you have to get in a vehicle or spaceship to do it. If you want to
hurt someone you punch them in the face or point a blaster at them.

Because of this depth of context and understanding all of those interleaved story lines
are quite stressful! We know, and care about everyone and fully appreciate the consequences
of every action and decision, what might happen and why.

In fact it was so stressful (and I was a tired to be fair) that about half way through S2e2
it all became too much for me and I switched to something else!

By coincidence I also had the second season of "Outer Range" on my watch list so gave that
a go. If you read my review of season 1 you will see that by the final episode I had
literally "lost the plot" and had no idea why anyone was doing what they were doing.
True, there had been some reveals, more of Royal's backstory and the story was advancing
at least a bit so I was prepared to give the new season a go.

So yes, it was well acted - Josh Brolin going head-to-head with Kevin Costner as the
rancher with the weight of the world on their shoulders and things did move further
forward but the whole feel of the show was very different, there was no tension
or stress, and I wondered why?

My conclusion is that in the world of Outer Range we don't know the rules so we don't
know the consequences of any action. We know that time travel is involved and wierd
shit is going down but that's all. Literally anything can happen - characters can
be in a near fatal coma one minute, up and about the next. Anyone can get hit
by a stampeding buffalo at any time, people disappear and re-appear all over the
place to very little impact.

To be fair to the writers I assume that they *are* indeed working within a set of
"rules" - that the world does have a coherent mechanic that will eventually be
revealed to us (at least as long as they aren't doing a "Lost" and painting
themselves so far into a corner they disappeared into the woodwork).

But until we, the viewer can understand those rules then nothing we watch
actually matters, whatever happens what might be undone in the next episode
and people could well be doing things are "rational" within their world view
but means nothing to us.

And I think that is the key difference between these shows - I may be a bit unfair
comparing them as they have different narrative structures and aims; and one takes
place against a vast backcloth of story and lore (although the other takes place
against a backcloth of our own world, and so we assume the 99.9% of that world
works as we understand it!). But my emotional reaction to both shows was completely 
different - heightened tension for Andor, indifference to Outer Range.

Does it matter? I'm not sure, but I think it does highlight that if you want
viewers to get really invested in your show then you are much better making
the "rules" clear from the outset rather than building your tension *through*
the gradual reveal of those rules.

In Andor the story is driven by characters making decsions (not necessarily 
the "right" ones but we can see where they are coming from and those decisions
make sense in their own terms). In Outer Range the story is driven by the
slow reveal of the underlying premise, characters act in ways that might
not make sense to us until we have that final reveal.

Which is better? Not for me to say, but I would say that an Andor-type
story is harder to write - if all the story mechanics are known upfront
then you *must* rely on character to provide motivation; if you keep
your story mechanic hidden then characters can do whatever you want
them to and you can adjust that mechanic to "explain" anything.

I'm going to carry on with both shows but just wanted to get my thoughts on
them down now.

Does this resonate with anyone? Can we analyse other shows on this basis?
What do you think?
