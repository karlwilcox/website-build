It all started with Tom Shippey really...

As you know from the [Tolkien Reading Project](/collections/tolkien/overview) Tom has made some
significant contributions to Tolkien scholarship. Having enjoyed his work there,
when an opportunity to listen to his lecture series "Heroes of Literature"
on Audible I gave it a go...

All of the usual suspects were there, Beowulf, Oddyseus, Frodo (yay!) there was
also Elizabeth Bennett (really?). Intriqued I visited my local Waterstones book store
to pick up a copy of "Pride and Predjudice", however there was a really nice
and reasonably priced "Collected Works" in hardback. So why not read them all?
And while you are at it, let's find out more about Jane herself and the time
she lived in...

Hence there's now a significant chunk of shelf space dedicated to Jane.

I have listed all these owned works in the [reading list here](/collections/jane-austen/reading-list) , 
and you can find my notes on each of
the works by searching out the "jane-austen" tag in my reviews section (TBD).
