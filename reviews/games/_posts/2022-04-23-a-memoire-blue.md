One of the nice things about having a XBox Game Pass subscription is that you can try out games that
I would probably never have looked at, let alone paid money for. This is very much one of those
serendipitous "it doesn't cost anything, I'll give it a go" benefits.

It is a very linear game, there's a fair bit of clicking to do but all you can click on is the
next step in the story. Despite that it does immerse you in the game. The story is fairly simple,
just a mother and daughter and a spiritual and physical journey that they take. The visuals
are strangely beautiful and beautifully strange, there's a lot of imagination at play here.

There's no real re-play value here but it is well worth a couple of hours to work through the whole
thing. Just sit back, click and enjoy.
