(Abandoned, after a while)

A suprisingly simple game with just a few possible actions that let you steer a disc shaped
ship through some very large and often astonishingly beautiful landscapes with the ultimate
aim of finding a launch ramp to take us to the next destination. There's not a lot too
it in terms of gameplay but the visuals are lovely and if you can get into the rhythm of
surface skimming then it is actually very relaxing. Unfortunately I got stuck in the
level with the giant trees rising from the bottom of deep, steep sided valleys and 
I just couldn't get anywhere to advance. Oh well...
