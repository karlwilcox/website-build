A straightforward jigsaw puzzle game which pretty much gets everything right.
There are dozens of pictures to choose from (I'm really enjoying working
through the bucolic and dreamy Chuck Pinson series). The game mechanic couldn't
be simpler, pick up a piece, place it on a monogram image that fades out from
the edges inwards. If it is in the right place it locks and tapes on the full
colour. And that's it you can have the edges sorted first if you want to, and
play some ambient music and hear a satisfying click when the pieces fit but I
prefer a silent game and an audiobook in the background.

A single puzzle can be finished in 10 to 15 minutes, there are a nice
affirmations on every loading screen and we get the finished result full screen
on completion. As casual, relaxing games go this is perfect. Good choice Apple
arcade editors!
