I've been looking forward to this since I heard it was coming to the Apple Arcade, and it didn't 
disappoint. It was a huge advance in gameplay from the first version but it didnt' need to be, 
there is already beauty, invention and puzzle challenges in the basic concept and all we
needed (and got) was some new levels. This is the sort of game that you want to solve
slowly and carefully, savouring each level because you know that ultimately you'll
reach the last one and not have that pleasure and buzz of getting to the final portal
and seeing the fireworks... A lovely game, thank you developers!
