This game was lovely! Really atmospheric 2D scrolling puzzler with superb artwork and really satisfying puzzles and a 
satisfying overall journey (literally and figuratively). You guide a small figure across a post apocolyptic
environment, on ships and other vehicles, on land, over and under the sea.

I managed most things on my own, there was one puzzle that
I couldn't solve without a walkthrough but should have been able to figure out (a real "doh!" moment) and I didn't
figure the mechanic for cooling the engine without help (although you could just wait for it to cool down by itself!)
and the section where you had to run against the wind was a bit annoying as it relied on button mashing and timing
rather than intelligence but I'll forgive that. Enjoyed almost every minute of this and would like to play more
in this genre.
