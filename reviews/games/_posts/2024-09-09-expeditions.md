Hey, I've finally found a showrunner/mud runner game that I really like!

All these games are part of the+ Bot Game Pass (great value in my view) so I've tried both mud and snow. 
I really wanted to like them, I like big trucks and slow, thoughtful games rather than frantic action, 
so these should have been good for me. Unfortunately I found them( quite literally) hard going-it took 
just long to make progress, with regular setbacks and quite a complicated progression system. And both 
settings are gloomy, verging on the grim! 

But Expeditions gets all of those things right! The locations are light, interesting and immersive.
Now it maybe because of my practice with the earlier games but I find I'm actually making progress with this one- 
I'm completing the objectives, and each objective opens up more than one new option so the next mission is wide open. 
Add to that the small tasks that can be completed while free roaming and I'm pretty hooked!
Driving is tricky, but not too tricky, and yes I have got hopelessly stuck or rolled my truck into 
ravine but I can clearly see this as the result of my own dumb moves not some arbitrary feature of 
the game so I'm content to accept the recovery to base and start over.

The addition of terms of specialist characters and equipment caches that you can set up and trade are an interesting 
expansion on game play and I want to see how those go.

So overall I'm well pleased here. another reason to stick with the game pass..

If anyone needs me tonight I'll be out in the Grand Canyon, trucking supplies and collecting dinosaur bones!
