Well that was a fun couple of evenings! A couple of hours each night served
to complete all of this, with just a single look at a walkthrough for something
that I should have been able to figure out for myself! There's perhaps a little
too much chat but that would be my only criticism. I really liked the simple
game mechanic, swallow up stuff with a hole, thet gets bigger the more you
swallow, and sometimes shoot stuff out again. And that's it! There's something
suprisingly satisfying about swallowing all that traffic... and the game even
gets a bit meta with the cut scene after the unwinnable first boss battle!

Another good option from the XBox Game Pass.
