We all know what to expect here and to a certaing extent have seen most of it before but it is
still just as relaxing and beautiful as the previous outings and adds some genuinely new
game mechanics (the paths hidden in the grass for example) and I really enjoyed steering the
sailing ship.

The chapters are also nicely paced in that solving a level is satisfying, gives you a sense of
achievement and fills up a pleasant period of time. Another triumph of the game developers art. 
Thanks again, Apple Arcade.
