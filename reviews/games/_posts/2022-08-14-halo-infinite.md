(Abandoned)

This is one of the "flagship" games that you get with the XBox Game Pass (along with Forza Horizon
and Flight Simulator). The visuals are lovely and I'm sure that the game play is very fulfilling
but not for me. After totally failing on just the training level (how do you climb the rope thing?
How do you aim and shoot consistently?) I admit that I just don't have the hand-eye coordination
to succeed at this (slightly bent arthritic finger joints probably don't help either). I need something
more gentle and cerebral and deleting this game will free 99Gb of disk space - which gets you a 
lot of gentle and cerebral games instead!.
