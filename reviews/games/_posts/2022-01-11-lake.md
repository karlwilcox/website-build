I absolutely loved this game! I've come late to gaming and this is the first
game that I have actually completed. I found it totally immersive and had
genuine feelings about all the characters, good and bad! I had a real night of
worry about Frank and whether I had said too much to the investigator; and Matt
was a real dick (he looked and acted so much like I did in the 80's it was
painful to watch). I was also totally invested in Meredith the main character -
if I had to deliver a package to Raven way

I felt real unease as a lone woman driving through the deep forest a long way
from town with slightly seedy and run-down houses. The town itself was as much
of a character, simply driving around was just a joy and I was absurdly pleased
to catch a glimpse of a deer in the woods, and meet the metal detectorist whos
voice you just might recognise!

I put a lot of thought into the decisions I was making and most of the way
through the game I had a pretty good idea of the choice I was going to make at
the end, only to change my mind when Monday morning finally rolled around!

I've been playing it over the last week and couldn't wait for everyone else to
go to bed so I could turn on the Xbox and find out what the Oregon weather had
in store for me, hopefully filling my office with that glorious sunshine. A
delight.
