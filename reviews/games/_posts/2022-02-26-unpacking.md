This is a surpisingly fulfilling game, both relaxing and giving you a sense of satisfaction for completion.
There was also a nice "life story" tying each of the individual stages together. You are presented with a
series of domestic rooms and a pile of packed cardboard boxes. Take items out of the box by clicking,
place them in the appropriate room in a place of your choice (also by clicking) and that's it!

My only very minor criticism is that the lovely pastel coloured isometric projection sometimes made it
hard to figure out what some of the smaller items were and hence which room they should go in.

Overall however I could really recommend this game, especially for an adult getting in to gaming
for the first time and not wanting to play some blood spattered shooter. Play this, unpack, sit
back and relax in the glow of a job well done!
