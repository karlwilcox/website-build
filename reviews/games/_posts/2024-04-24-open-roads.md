This is soaked in an atmosphere of melancholy, decay and deep time. There is a 
sweet story and lovely artwork (you can almost smell the dust and damp!). The
gameplay was **very** linear but better for it because the story then becomes
the focus rather than lots of clicking and searching. The voice acting was
really good and the writing was excellent. Just like real lide the story
doesn't end, just more potentialities open up.

The road goes ever on...
