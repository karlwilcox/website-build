Picked this up as part of the Apple Arcade that I subscribe to (effectively free if you want iCloud,
Apple TV+ and email forwarding). This was a fun little game, clearly inspired by Monument Valley
but with some clever Lego Brick tricks. I had to think hard about a few of the puzzles but never
had to look up a walkthrough so that's always a sign that the difficulty level is spot on!
This was a great, fun little time-waster that I enjoyed and gained a lot of satisfaction
from completing.
