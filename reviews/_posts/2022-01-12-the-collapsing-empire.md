I did enjoy this but you have to accept the rather contrived physics that are setup in order to enable the story. Scalzi is always good at characters and once the scene was set this moved along at a good pace and there's no arguing that once he has the setup he uses it to the full to drive the motivations of the characters and the structure of the empire.
