I thought this was joyful, alive, bold (both in visuals and story-telling) and worth
the Netflix subscription on its own (well, almost...).

What I really liked is that the level of explanation and background is just right -
we (gradually, and not in a forced way) get the back stories of the characters but
the writers feel no need (quite rightly) to explain why this world has both sailing
ships and artificial fabrics with zippers. The production design in all respects was
a triumph. And the language had power in its simplicity, who wouldn't want to
sail the Deep Blue and seek out the Grand Line?

Next season please!
