Being a list of brief notes on other culture consumed over the last few months that I either abandoned or don't feel needs a longer discussion.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Being the Ricardos** I did enjoy this, very authentic to look at, well acted but I did lose the thread of things at times.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Greyhound** Tom Hanks captaining a destroyer guarding an Atlantic convoy. Well acted by all, the
helmet worn by the radio operator was historically authentic but did make him look like Dark Helmet from
'Spaceballs'; and the taunting chat with the submarine was most certainly NOT historically authentic and
actually quite silly.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Finch** More Tom Hanks but accompanied only by his dog and a robot (wonder if Covid restrictions had
any part to play here...?) in a post-apocalyptic future. Surprisingly moving, made you cry over a
dumb robot.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **The Power of the Dog** Powerful film, a very cleverly told story about 1910s(/) cowboy life, not a period
often portrayed. Well acted, probably deserving of its awards but not something I would particularly want
to watch again.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Red Notice** Totally daft action movie that doesn't really take anything too seriously and is all the
better for it.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **French Exit** good concept with funny and unexpectedm moments but far too long on the atmospheric lingering shots

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **The Weekend Away** Poorly acted harmless fun, don't bother turning on your brain or expect to get too much out of this

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **The Adam Project** fun movie, Ryan Reynolds rarely makes a bad choice of role
and plays this one well, but I did feel that tedious and unnecessary action scenes made the film longer than it needed to be

{% include icon shape="game" %} **OMNO** Xbox game (abandoned) This was an open world puzzler that looked absolutely beautiful and was a delight
to move around. The puzzles were satisfying, not overly complex but challenging enough to be interested, however I just gave  up when I had 
figured out what was needed to solve a puzzle but that the actual execution required stupidly accurate button-mashing that my arthritic fingers just couldn't do!

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard** fast paced fun and funny but leave your credibility at home! At least it doesn't take
itself seriously, and the "hints" scene about where our hero should go next was a knowing (and funny) nod to unlikely coincidences in the movies.

{% include icon shape="tvshow" %} **Wolf Like Me** Another modern update on the werewolf theme with some cover use of the standard tropes in a 
fairly simple story that was pleasingly told. Whether that is enough to get me demanding a second season I'm not so sure.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Our Ladies** Story of a religious Girl's School trip to a choir contest in the big city.
Slightly aimless but entertaining, not a great advertisement for Scottish men.
