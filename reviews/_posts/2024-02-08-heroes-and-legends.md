Tom is always great to listen to, whatever he is talking about and this is no exception. 
In each lecture he picks a character from literature or legend and talks about their 
origins, meaning in the wider world and impact on others. some are only to be expected, 
Odysseus and Frodo, others more unexpected like Natty Bumpo and Elizabeth Bennett. 
This last was really interesting and lead to my comprehensive Jane Austen reading project
(thanks for that Tom!)
He gives a useful summary of each story and drew some interesting connections, for example to
government overreach in the present day A very enjoyable and thought-provoking course 
that I highly recommend.
