An impulse buy while getting emergency bananas from Waitrose... attracted by the cover, which
turns out to be quite clever showing the island within multiple, enclosing frames (of narrative).

We have a deeply unrealiable narrator (who admits this upfront!) and a small cast of characters,
largely actors isolated on a small Greek Island by a storm ("the Fury" of the title - although
this could also describe some of the characters and their actions, another clever touch).

I started out really enjoying this and was invested in all the characters and their
situation and did find it annoying when all this was up-ended by yet another plot twist.
I felt a bit cheated, even though we'd been warned about the narrator but I did get over
that and have finished the whole book in 3 days so it clearly didn't annoy me enough
to stop reading!

This is a clever book by an accomplished author, indeed it is almost but not quite
too clever to be a great read by the author has just finessed it on the right side
of "great", although I'm not convinced it would make a good re-read unless
some years down the road when I've forgotten a lot of it!

I can see this being a good (if possibly quite confusing) film, especially
if  you try to tell the story without some sort of meta-narration.
