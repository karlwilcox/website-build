I'm not sure how I feel about this one!

We have a first person view of Paige Mahoney, a clairvoyant in an alt-history version of near future London in which those 
with such powers are hounded and imprisoned. The author asks a fair amount of her readers as we expected to accept
and understand the world as Paige sees it, which is very different from our own. Then within a few chapters Paige
herself finds that the world is not even how she thinks it is but is even stranger! These discoveries take place
in a alt-history near Victorian version of Oxford turned penal colony (it does all make sense, honestly!) This
Oxford is beautifully realised, inevitably to be compared with the settings of "Babel" by R. F. Kuang
and Lyra's Oxford of Phillip Pullman but in fact very different from both.

So yes, I did enjoy reading this, it was exciting with lots of strong and strongly drawn characters,
very well written and not speaking down to the readership. My real reservation is that I'm not really sure
what sort of commitment that I would be making if I continue. This is *very* much the first book
of a series - there is (spoiler alert) absolutely **NO** closure here. Nothing is resolved and
there are more loose ends than a pom-pom ball. So how much do I need to read before I get my
pay off? That's my question!

Further, there is note that this anniversary edition has been revised and there may be minor
inconsistencies with the previous versions of the sequels, which themselves are to be
revised during 2024. So I would really want / need to find and read these revised version too...

At time of writing I haven't decided what to do yet! Watch this space...
