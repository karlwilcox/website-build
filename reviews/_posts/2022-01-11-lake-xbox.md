I absolutely loved this game! I've come late to gaming and this is the first game that I have actually completed. I found it
totally immersive and had genuine feelings about all the characters, good and bad! I had a real night of worry about Frank and
whether I had said too much to the investigator; and Matt was a real dick (he looked and acted so much like I did in the 80's
it was painful to watch). I was also totally invested in Meredith the main character - if I had to deliver a package to Raven way

I felt real unease as a lone woman driving through the deep forest a long way from town with slightly seedy and run-down houses.
The town itself was as much of a character, simply driving around was just a joy and I was absurdly pleased to catch a glimpse
of a deer in the woods, and meet the metal detectorist whos voice you just might recognise!

I put a lot of thought into the decisions I was making and most of the way through the game I had a
pretty good idea of the choice
I was going to make at the end, only to change my mind when Monday morning finally rolled around!

I've been playing it over the
last week and couldn't wait for everyone else to go to bed so I could turn on the Xbox and find out what the Oregon weather
had in store for me, hopefully filling my office with that glorious sunshine. A delight.
