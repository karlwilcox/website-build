Set in Cornwall and taking place over two timelines this is typically Rachel Hore fare -
broken lives recovered through a change of scenery and a satisfying ending. A cottage
is rented, a hotel involved, art lessons and ancient mysteries. The only thing 
lacking was any serious peril, so a great comfort read.
