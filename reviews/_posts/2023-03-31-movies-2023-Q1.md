Being a list of brief notes on other movies that I've watched but don't care enough about to write more...

**Welcome to Chippendale** all new to me, fascinating story, well told; couldn't help
noticing similarity between the main character here and his counterpart in "The Dropout". 

**Shotgun Wedding** daft but fun harmless popcorn movie lifted above the ordinary by
Jennifer Coolidge and Lennie Kravitz(!)

**Lady Chatterly's Lover (2022)** nicely done, believable and well acted. enjoyed this.

**Bank of Dave** Corny, simplistic, emotionally manipulative, and takes huge liberties with the true story, but I absolutely loved this!

**Father Stu** interesting story, well acted but accent was almost unintelligible (and
nothing like the real priest, according to the clips at the end!)

**Your Place or Mine** unlikely premise but fun movie, albeit about rich privileged
people. Everything everywhere was so clean!
