Definitely one for what Iain Banks refers to as "armamentophiles" - enough rail guns, rotoguns, particle beams
and tactical nukes for everyone, there hasn't been a party like this since "Hilldiggers"!

All this weaponry is woven around a stand-alone novel about Piper, citizen of the Cyberat, a people
indoctrinated to believe that the more cyborg the better and outside the polity but still of potential
interest to the Prador. We do come across old friends such as AI golems, Agents (not Cormac) and my
favourite, War Factory Room 101 in his pre-totally bat-shit crazy days.

Despite all the explosions there is still a human story about belonging, free will and morality, both
in war and peace so this turned out to be suprisingly deep. Good work Neal!
