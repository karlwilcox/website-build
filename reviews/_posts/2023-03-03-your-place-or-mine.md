A hopelessly unrealistic movie with a deeply unlikely premise about privilged white people that we really should dislike,
but if you suspend the disbelief and accept that the world really
is as clean as it looks here then this can be a good way to pass your
time. There was something about house swapping, or possibly life swapping
but everything looks very nice and the ending could be considered a
tear-jerker if you were feeling particularly sentimental that day...
