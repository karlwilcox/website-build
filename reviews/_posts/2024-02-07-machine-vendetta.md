Al is back! An excellent conclusion to the Dreyfuss series. Cleverly plotted and it moves
at a cracking pace with some great scenes that fit neatly in to the greater
"Revelation Space" universe. It isn't forced but there are ominous hints of the plague to
come.

There's nothing especially new here since we know almost all of the characters (good and
bad) and situations from the earlier books but they are re-worked way in interesting
and plausible new ways. This is a clever genuine "detective" story in which our hero
has to pull together the threads from several apparently unrelated events and
work out how this links into the previous cases. Great work!
