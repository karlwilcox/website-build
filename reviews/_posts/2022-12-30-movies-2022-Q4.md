Being a list of brief notes on other movies that I've watched but don't care enough about to write more...

**Elvis** Interesting story, annoying in-your-face editing, and way too much mumbling to follow what was going on without
subtitles. But it has inspired me to buy an Elvis biography... (later: but not actually finish reading it)

**"The Phantom of the Open**, tour-def-force acting by Mark Rylance in a enjoyable caper - the sort of movie that seems to be coming something of a British cinema staple. Concerns a
(very) mediocre golfer bluffing and blagging his way into the British Open

**The Duke** - great fun, clever cinematography and an BAFTA worthy performance from Jim Broadbent telling the story of the theft of a painting. apparently a bizarre
but true story
