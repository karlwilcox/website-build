I realise that I have rather restricted myself in the "culture consumed" postings so far by only listing those things I've actually finished (or at least given up on). That precludes quite a lot of culture that I consumed on a regular, ongoing basis.

Hence, just for completeness here are the magazines that I read most issues of. (This may seem like a lot, but I use the Readly app, which I consider fantastic value for money! I do however also pay for my Economist suscription).

## Read Most of Every Issue

*   The Economist (\*)
*   PC Pro
*   Rail
*   Air International
*   Modern Railways
*   Aviation News
*   British Railway Modelling
*   Hornby Magazine
*   Shipping
*   Rail Express
*   Model Rail
*   Railways Illustrated
*   Flying
*   Plane & Pilot
*   Ships Monthly

(\*) I'm aware that the Economist describes itself as a newspaper but it looks more like a magazine to me...
Update: 2024 I did let my subscription to the Economist lapse as the full price renewal was quite a bit, and
I do get a full subscription to the Financial Times through my employer and generally at lesat skim
the headlines of that every day
