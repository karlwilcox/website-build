A quirky delight. Beautifully written, slow paced n(truth be told, not a lot actually happens) but a wonderful comfort read. We learn of Takako and her failed engagement taking refuge
in her uncles dusty bookshop, the characters she meets and the slow recovery from her trauma. The bookstore district of Tokyo almost becomes another character here and makes you
long to visit! Worth a re-read whenever you are feeling a bit low. I have the sequel on my wishlist...
