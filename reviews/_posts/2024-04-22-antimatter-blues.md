There was a point about two-thirds of the way through were snarky banter crossed the line into irritating bickering, but apart from that I did read the whole thing in 3 days! A worthy sequel, if something of an exhausting read. Not quite as good as the first one, but works within the limits set by the course of the previous volume.
