It's great to see some science fiction with humour and heart! This show passed under 
the radar for me (possibly because of the non-obvious SF title) so I've only recently
started to watch but I have really enjoyed it. The characters are all great although
some of the stories are a little weak. It is true that there is nothing ground
breaking here, you could point to pre-cursors for every character, device and
plot twist to something in the Star Trek universe but that doesn't really matter,
this is a fun watch that cares about its source material and makes up care for
the characters. 

Looking forward to catching up on the rest of the seasons.
