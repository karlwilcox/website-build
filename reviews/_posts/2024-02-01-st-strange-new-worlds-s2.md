This was old school Star Trek nostalgia and I really enjoyed it! The characters had
genuine and interesting story arcs (although Nurse Chapel's inevitable survival
in the last episode seemed a bit unlikely!).

The show has certainly found its feet and is proceeding with confidence and
willingness to stretch the boundaries. Two stand out examples were the
"Lower Decks" cross-over episode which was brilliant fun; and the musical
episode which was just a sublime and bravura piece of television! Not only
was it fun but the writers made a real effort to make the singing an 
integral (if even more unlikely!) and necessary part of the story.

I'm not a big fan of the set-piece battles (I prefer the more intimate
character studies) but I appreciate the desire for a big finish to set
up the next season, before which I could happily do a re-watch of all
these episodes first.
