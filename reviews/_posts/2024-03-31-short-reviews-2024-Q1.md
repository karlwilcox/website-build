Being a list of brief notes on other culture consumed over the last few months that I either abandoned or don't feel needs a longer discussion.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Freelance** You can tell from the promo image that this would be a load of nonsense
but it was harmless nonsense and didn't take itself too seriously, although it did
kind of overcook all the gun battles to the point of stupidity...

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **About My Father** Robert de Niro talking Italian ("... italian...") Just the right side of being
cringey (but only just) and there were some funny scenes, but most characters had barely one dimension let alone two!

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **The creator** Disney+ (Unfinished) A lovely vintage montage at the start but
everything else seemed cliched and derivative - way to go on the 2D characterization there. I'm sure that there
will be redemption and growth along the way but I'm not willing to spend another 2 or 3 hours to find out!

{% include icon shape="tvshow" %} **Criminal Record#** Apple TV+ This really draws you in, a very compelling story. Peter Capaldi was great and the acting all round was top notch.
Story about a possibly corrupt cop and a rookie investigating a series of possibly linked crimes. Cleverly written

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Silver and the Book of Dreams** a Amazon Prime TV Fantasy about dreams becoming real and shared.
A strange and unusual film-visual and hyper-real, dreamlike but also grounded. Well worth watching.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Guardians of the Galaxy 3** (Unfinished) Abandoned this after a while. It looks great,
clearly lots of money spent on it but I just couldn't get into this enough to care about any of the characters
to watch it until the end.
