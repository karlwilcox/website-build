"Disappointing" - Karl

"Self-indulgent" - also Karl

"Hoping volume 3 is better" - still Karl

More tales of our witch and her vampire lover as she learns more of her powers while
hiding in the past.

Something of a slog sadly. The previous volume was a cracking read that charged along-this 
book felt like it was( almost literally) marking time. 360 pages that don't really advance 
the plot significantly and it seems like an excuse to shoehorn in lots of historical sites 
and even more characters to put out the impressive list of dramatis personae.
