<p>Wow. Even though I'd seen the film this was a gripping read. It arrived on Friday evening and I'd finished it by Saturday night. So pleased I have the next three to read too, but going to take a break first as it was kind of intense! Fantastic story, rich characters, satisfying ending, almost the perfect Aussie crime read. Would recommend to anyone as a great introduction to the genre.</p>
