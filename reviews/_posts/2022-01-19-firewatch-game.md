A very linear, but absorbing story. There was something I failed to find in the tent (got scared about being caught!) and went back to the cabin on stilts, but had to do it all again the next day before I could move on. Quite a lonely experience (deliberately), but beautifully rendered and I for one could lose my bearings within 50 feet of the watch tower so perhaps I'm not the woodsman I thought I was. Would like to try more games like this.
