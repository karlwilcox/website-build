This has all the right Space Opera tropes - spaceships, galaxy spanning civilizations, alien races, ancient technologies, conflict and politics and is well written,
moving along at a good pace. (You can hear the "but" coming along can't you...) But.... the sum of those parts just didn't achieve
greatness for me. I might not be doing it full justice and perhaps I should read it again someday and revisit this review. But please
don't let my views put you off, I did get to the end of this and didn't take any breaks so it certainly wasn't bad, I just don't
remember anything from it!
