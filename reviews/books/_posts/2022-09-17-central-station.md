This was beautifully written and absolutely full of atmosphere but ultimately I was a
bit disappointed. There were lots of scenes but there didn't seem to be a particular
story arc. I don't want to put anyone off, perhaps it is enough to be a montage or
a mood-piece, or maybe there was something deeper going on that I didn't
appreciate but really I expect more pay off for my reading time!

And the book is worth having just for the sublime cover art.
