Another delightful, gentle, if rather mournful stroll through the Jimbocho
bookstore district that makes you want to idle away your days browsing the
shelves and reading your purchases sitting at the window table in the
**Saveur**. Just a really lovely story of real people with their own issues
and problems moving through life supported and propelled by books and the
stories they tell. A delight.
