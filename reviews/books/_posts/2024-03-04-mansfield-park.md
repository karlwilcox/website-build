Not quite as much fun as Sts or PtP, the supporting characters are more interesting than the leads. Fanny indeed is 
(intentionally) a bit dreary and feeble. There's almost a connection with Mary Poppins here in that it is Sir Bertram
(the Mr. Banks analogue) that goes on the longest (physical and spiritual) journey, changing the most through the 
course of the novel. This (like all Austen) would bear re-reading and I will report further then.
