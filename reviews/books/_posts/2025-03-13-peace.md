Following straight on from finishing book 1 I worked thorugh this in just a few days
and enjoyed every moment. It was pretty much the same forumla as the prevoius book,
cop-under-a-cloud manages small town police station dealing with crimes from the
most trivial up to murder and animal mutilation that brings in the national press.
All the characters have real depth and motivation and you do get a genuine sense of place.

What I really liked about this was how all the different strands were neatly
resolved, everything tied up by the end and nothing left loose to be continued
in the next book. It makes for a very satisfying read that is stand-alone but still
leaves you ready and eager for the next one.
