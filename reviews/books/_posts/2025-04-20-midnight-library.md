This is another example of why I should avoid so much book switching! The
Midnight Library is much more effective as a single read through, rather than
having several multi- week gaps.

The gaps arose because I did feel that the story dragged a little two thirds of
the way through. We learn of a young woman for whom everything is going wrong,
attempting suicide and being shown all the alternative lives that she could
have had.

Rather than write another self-help book the author has put the message into a
fairly engaging story and I did buy that message. You are exactly where you are
supposed to be, the future is as yet unwritten and don't do regrets!

The story wasn't uplifting exactly, but it was reassuring, and well told for
the most part, perhaps one too many alternative lives but a worthwhile and
enjoyable read. Not sure I would read again though.
