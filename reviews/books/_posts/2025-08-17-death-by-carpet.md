Amazon have been bundling between 5 and 10 police procedurals into a single
eBook and selling them off for 99p. There are at least a dozen of these bundles
now, each of which gets you a lot of pages for less than a pound but are they
worth even that much? Lets try a few and find out, starting with “Death by
Carpet”, the first of a seven book pack written by P.F. Ford

We open with a heavy, carpet-wrapped object being thrown into a river (leaving
a possibly incriminating piece of string behind) but then immediately forget
all of that for almost the rest of the book and follow our sub-title eponymous
heroes as they get dumped with a cold missing person case as a potential way to
redeem themselves for perceived cock-ups in their (separate) last cases. It
soons turns out that a senior officer involved in both of those cases might be
involved so not only there is a chance of redemption but also maybe revenge!

From there on in it becomes a fairly straightforward police procedural with all
the usual suspects- supportive but harried boss, hacker contact able to perform
unexplained technical feats, dangerous but seductive women and all. The cover
blurb claims witty banter, which is something of a stretch (I will admit only
the “banter”) but the story moves along interestingly enough.

The carpet plays almost no part in the story being mentioned in the prologue
and never again. It is not the murder weapon. The string is equally irrelevant.

Overall, a perfectly enjoyable, if undemanding crime story that could almost be
churned out on a production line basis by an AI one day. A throwaway novel to
pass the time and never read again.
