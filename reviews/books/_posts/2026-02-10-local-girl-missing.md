I listened to this on audible as it was part of a two for one deal and I've
enjoyed some of her written works.

This tile is that I have two timelines, the first being the inner thoughts of
Frankie in the present day, and the other being diary entries by her best
friend Sophie that were made 20 years ago. Sophie disappeared shortly
afterwards, apparently falling by accident from the ruined pier of the seaside
Home.

Daniel, Sophie's brother, contact Frankie and persuade her to come back to her
hometown where they both grew up as possible remain remains of Sophie had been
found and he wanted her help to find out what it really happened.

Things get quite dark after that, in a psychological way, not horrific or
graphic but disturbing for Frankie. Who is behind all of this, and what are
they trying to hide?

I enjoyed this, there were plenty of twists and the way things were gradually
revealed through the pages of the diary was a nice plot device, as was Frankie
addressing her thoughts to the Sophie that she had lost all those years ago.

The seaside town in winter, Oldcliff, is well drawn and the characters are
interesting and well realised. The narration was clear but oddly quiet audible
and I had to turn up the volume more than usual other than that, this was an
enjoyable lesson, but only for the once, I wouldn't want to come back to this
as the revelations wouldn't have the same impact a second time around.
