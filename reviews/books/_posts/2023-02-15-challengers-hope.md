Poor Nick has a tough time on his first actual command at the hands of a bullying and weak admiral
(honestly, how do these guys promoted?). As usual the bad guys are irredeemably bad, the good
guys have enormous sticks up their arses (especially our hero) and the women are just baby
factories but there are still surprisingly moving scenes that can bring tears to my eyes.

A guilty pleasure but I'd still read it again.
