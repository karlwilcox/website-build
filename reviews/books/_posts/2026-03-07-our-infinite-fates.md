This was an impulse buy on the way out of Waterstones and boy was it a good
purchase to make! Not only does it entitle me to a free coffee during February;
it came with a rather cool promotional tote bag in cherry pink and the young
lady that served me admitted that she was reading it herself and couldn’t wait
until her break to find out more. And what a good read it is!

I won’t summarise the plot beyond what is written on the back because I don’t
want to spoil anyone else’s pleasure - Evelyn and Arden are reincarnated over
hundreds of years but their lives end tragically before their 18th birthday at
their own hands. Hoever, in the latest incarnation, in 2022 Wales Evelyn needs
to donate bone marrow to save her younger sister but her birthday is rapidly
approaching so she needs to find the origin of this curse and break it.

We learn much of their previous lives and the many people that they love and
lose and there are mediations on those themes, sometimes in the form of Arden’s
poetry. This is a lovely book, it is a little gruesome in places, but the
relationship between Evelyn and Arden is written in such a powerful fashion
that the passion, love, hurt and loss bursts from the page; and the story is
interesting, compelling and well constructed.

Like the shop assistant, I was eager to get back into this world and finished
the whole thing inside two days. Highly recommend.
