Psychological thriller about a missing husband. Tightly written and urgently
compelling, although the premise based on the London jogger who pushed someone
in front of a bus is slightly unsettling as it was a real case with real people
and it seems slightly creepy to build a work of fiction around it. The reaction
of our heroine, going without sleep for 10 days was also a bit harrowing but
well described.

If you can get past that this is a pretty good thriller that does offer a
plausible rationale for that unpleasant event, although it doesn’t break any
new ground and the final denouement is a bit long and gruesome, especially
since we can pretty much guess the outcome.

A 99p deal of the day from Amazon that was worth the money but I’m glad I
didn’t pay for the physical paperback. Competent but not worth a re-read. And
searching for the book cover revealed a surprisingly large number of
identically titled works! Make sure you get the right one…
