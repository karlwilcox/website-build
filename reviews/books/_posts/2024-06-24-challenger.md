This is an interesting companion work to "The Challenger Launch Decision" (also
recently reviewed). This work is less technical and more human, although I think it
reached a different conclusion-If this was the only book that I had read on the topic I think
I would be a bit disappointed because to get the most out of it I was often referring
to other sources, especially for photos, frequently from the Roger's commission report.
That report itself was very clearly written and very helpful.

Overall, "Challenger" is a good introduction but far from providing the full picture.
