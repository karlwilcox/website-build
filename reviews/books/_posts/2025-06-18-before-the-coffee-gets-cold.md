An excellent read, so cleverly constructed. Such a small stage (literally, as
it is based on a play) and a tight set of constraints on the storytelling (the
“rules” of time travel) yet the store are so full of life and say moving. And
the smell of coffee pervades every page.

Key sentiment: “the present doesn’t change but the heart does”.

An absolute delight, looking forward to completing the series.
