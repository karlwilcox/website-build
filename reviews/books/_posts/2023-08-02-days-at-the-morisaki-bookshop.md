A quirky delight. Beautifully written, slow paced (truth be told, not a lot
actually happens) but a wonderful comfort read. We learn of Takako and her
failed engagement taking refuge in her uncles dusty bookshop, the characters
she meets and the slow recovery from her trauma. The bookstore district of
Tokyo almost becomes another character here and makes you long to visit! Worth
a re-read whenever you are feeling a bit low. I have the sequel on my
wishlist...
