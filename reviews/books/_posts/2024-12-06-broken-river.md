Another book of intertwined timelines â€“ fortunately of equal interest (I like
the previous) and we even get cameo appearances from most of our favourite
characters from the previous books!

This is quite a complex tale (in both timelines) so not ideal as a
10-minute-at-a-time bedtime book the way I was reading it, this would've been
much more impactful as a two or three day binge read.

We are back with Nell and Ivan (who has got over his traumatic past), again
with the lovely little illustrated map the geography this time plays a vital
role in the story which in an almost not quite believable twist also involves
Nell's own traumatic past (but hey, it's a small country population wise and
coincidences do happen).

Read this book, it is not perhaps his best but it's up there in the top
places.
