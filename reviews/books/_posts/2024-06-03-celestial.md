 Despite making it all the way to the end, I can't say I really enjoyed this.
 It started well, and the premise, somewhat "for all mankind" related was
 something I was interested in finding more about. Unfortunately, the more we
 went along I came to realise that all of the hard retro science-fiction was
 gone and were replaced by the contents of someone's head. And once we get
 there of course there are no longer any rules, anything can happen without any
 need to explain anything and most peoples heads are a mess of neuroses and
 issues and this head was no different. Disappointing to be honest.
