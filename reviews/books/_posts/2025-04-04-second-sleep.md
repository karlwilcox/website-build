(with spoilers)

Sorry, but this was a major disappointment. I really liked" conclave",
which I have read twice and would happily read again, but this take on post-apocalytipic fiction falls flat.

The basic conceit is that 500 years after some unspecified fall of civilization life has returned 
and is *exactly* like that of medieval
England. Everything is just like it was in the middle Ages with all
the same religious structures and
attitudes and everything about today's world has been forgotten - oh,
apart from this one old guy who can even tell you how heated windscreens work.

It does build well to a climax, albeit with a very convenient
land slide that neatly separates our protagonists from the bad guys
but the big reveal
is left to your imagination. Got a
genuine "WTF" from me when I
turned the last page.

Cannot recommend.
