(with spoilers)

Sorry, but this was a major disappointment. I really liked" conclave", which I
have read twice and would happily read again, but this take on
post-apocalytipic fiction falls flat.

The basic conceit is that 500 years after some unspecified fall of civilization
life has returned and is *exactly* like that of medieval England. Everything is
just like it was in the middle Ages with all the same religious structures and
attitudes and everything about today's world has been forgotten - oh, apart
from this one old guy who can even tell you how heated windscreens work.

It does build well to a climax, albeit with a very convenient land slide that
neatly separates our protagonists from the bad guys but the big reveal is left
to your imagination. Got a genuine "WTF" from me when I turned the last page.

Cannot recommend.
