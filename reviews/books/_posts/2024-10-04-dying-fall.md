A chance of scene from Norfolk as both Ruth and Nelson head to Blackpool for different
(reasonably plausible!) reasons. There's a new build university called Pendle that feels
incredibly flimsy and just a plot device (we only ever come across 4 or people there in total and most of the
time the entire, single, building is largely empty). So I don't totally buy the premise
but once it gets going there's enough to keep me hooked, although the strain between
Ruth and Nelson is limiting both their own interactions and the coherence of the story -
I can't see our author being able to take this much further while still keeping things
credible, but there's another 10(!) books to go. I can't imagine how that is
going to work out...

There was, I admit, a terrific piece of mis-direction that had me really annoyed (how
could they do that to my absolutely favourite character!) until the reveal and it 
was all cleared up. Clever, and it did prove to me how much I cared!
