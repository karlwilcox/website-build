Another tale of everyday life in Scottish gangster families... 

A great fictitious location (another big bridge!) and a very cleverly plotted story in which
our protagonist returns to the town of his birth to attend a funeral, having been run out
of town some years before after embarrassing himself (and the aforementioned gangster family).
Inevitably this is brought up again, along with many other past secrets (so typical Banks
in that respect.) I originally noted that I thought there were some loose ends left hanging
but I probably need to have a re-read to recall what they are. Another solid piece of work
that cements Iain's position in the pantheon of great Scottish authors. Will be interested
to dig out the BBC show on the iPlayer if it is still available...
