A stand-alone novel in the Polity series, Jack is a clone sold to the prador but different
from his 19 fellows. At heart this was a good story but the body count and the detailed
descriptions of all the violence seemed to drag it out. Tighten up the fight scenes 
and this might have been a great novella rather than an OK book. But still a worthwhile
addition to the Polity universe, especially if you are completist.
