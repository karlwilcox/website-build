Listened to this as audiobook, which was well read but I had to go back over 
several chapters as I didn't listen to it continuously. It is complex story
and best followed all the way through without significant breaks! 
We have an auctioneer cataloguing paintings in a long-locked Paris
apartment and uncovering a series of intertwined mysteries leading
back to the second World War. Karen
is always reliable at a good story with a rewarding ending.
