Jojo at her most comforting, with a clash of cultures as two women meet, one a hard-pressed Londoner,
the other effectively a gangster's wife from an equally hard background who soon returns to it.

There's a few slightly improbable events but they do at least serve to move the plot along, and the
ending is wrapped up all rather too neatly (especially the chance meeting with the lady cop and 
the subsequent actions) but none of this actually matters! This was just a great comfort read
in which alls well that ends well and we have a lot of fun on the way.
