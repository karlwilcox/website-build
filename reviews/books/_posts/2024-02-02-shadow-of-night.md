"Disappointing" - Karl

"Self-indulgent" - also Karl

"Hoping volume 3 is better" - still Karl

More tales of our witch and her vampire lover as she learns more of her powers while
hiding in the past.

Something of a slog sadly. The previous volume was a cracking read that charged along-this
book felt like it was( almost literally) marking time. 360 pages that don't really advance
the plot significantly and it seems like an excuse to shoehorn in lots of historical sites
and even more characters to pad out the impressive list of dramatis personae.

To be honest I felt this was very self-indulgent by an obviously very skilled
and knowledgeable historian vicariously living out her own time-travelling
fantasies through her characters. The story itself, just seemed to be literally
marking time as the plot didn’t really advance at all but our characters got to
observe many interesting periods of history. I realise that Diana was healing
from her wounds and learning her new powers and thus there was an intentional
slow down in the plot line but it didn’t make for a really exciting read.
