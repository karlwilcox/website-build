Part of the whole set, bought when they were all one of the Amazon deal of the
day. I like these kind of things as they are a very low risk way of checking
out whether a author is of interest. Fortunately for Emilia, I really liked
this one. Yes, it is cozy crime without any real peril but it is better for it.
The characters are engaging and have interesting unbelievable back stories and
cover a wide range or ages. The main characters are on the surface quite ill
matched, a police sergeant widow and a washed up detective now living eyes wife
family farm, so neither of them actually have any authority but this makes the
story more interesting. The supporting characters include the local police
constable, a coffee shop owner and a would be writer who will work together to
solve a murder and reveal all the reasons behind it. I like the story, it
wasn't at all obvious what was going on and it was a nice introduction to the
setting of the detective agency. I'll be happy to work through the rest of
these whenever I fancy a comfort read.
