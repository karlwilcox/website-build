A kitchen extension is underway in a small town in the west country when bodies
are found under the patio! Over the next few months a twisty tail is revealed
dating back some 40 years and involving three generations of the same family,
long hidden secrets and much swapping of identities.

This is told over multiple time periods and from several points of view - while
this might sound confusing the author executes it well, this is obviously a
carefully and cleverly plotted novel which reads and “hangs together” well.

My main concern is that the multiple viewpoints leave us without a main
protagonist that we can invest in (and in this respect the poor husband of the
couple gets very short shrift and doesn’t get to contribute much at all apart
from being supportive). I did like the fact that all involved kept the police
fully informed (as I think is likely) despite them being threatened and told
not to tell the cops. They always immediately did and it urns out to be the
right thing to do (well, apart from the final reveal, but by then it doesn’t
really matter so again is a plausible reaction).

So a good story, well told but without an obvious single protagonist I couldn’t
really get deeply engaged. Still worth reading however.
