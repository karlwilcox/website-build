I missed this one out on my initial read of the 'Shetland' books as I inadvertently read a spoiler
on Amazon. This is the one where Perez returns home to Fair Isle with his new wife and step-daughter
but bad things happen at the bird watching lodge (which, interestingly, burnt down in real life soon
after and is being rebuilt with modular sections). Our Jimmy shows a real lack of care and attention
when the going gets tough and it ends badly. Yes, he should feel guilty and bad about that, very 
poor decision making! But yes, just as good as the others in the series and the character arc continues.
