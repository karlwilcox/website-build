I'm listening to this as an audio book since it was part of a 2 for 1 offer and
I didn’t notice that the paperback was already in my to-be-read pile!

This is the complicated story of an artist, her missing, wastrel, debt-ridden
ex-husband, her long time companion and those who were bequeathed all of her
paintings — themselves a complicated family! It is also complex structurally,
with multiple viewpoints and much told in flashbacks. A lot of the action (and
plot devices) revolve around the island which is the artist’s home and which is
only accessible at low tide.

Despite all that complexity the story is well told and not confusing. The
narration is clear, enthralling (for reader) on as things are gradually
revealed. It’s actually hard to characterise this or squeeze it into a genre as
there are family and relationship issues, a missing person mystery, art history
and the island itself all intertwined into a very satisfying whole. There are
plenty of twists especially at the end (I had to listen to the final chapter
twice to straighten out what happened) and our sympathies can vary over time
and across characters as the author manipulates our emotions brilliantly.

Ms Hawkins is clearly an accomplished writer — I think I have The Girl on the
Train on my Kindle and I’d like to compare that with this book and with the US
transplanted movie that I recall watching a few years ago…
