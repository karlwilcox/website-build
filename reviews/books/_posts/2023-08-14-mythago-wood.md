I read this at the prompting of one of the great courses on science fiction and
fantasy literature as I had never heard of it but the course leader sang its
praises. It is the story of a mysterious wood adjacent to our hero’s house into
which his father disappeared some years ago and his search both to understand
the woods based on found notes and records and to find his father.

The wood is a lovingly described with a mixture of beauty, mystery and menace
and is people by all sorts of strange creatures. There is a resolution of sorts
at the end but this is the first of a trilogy so there are still further
mysteries to unravel. I have not at the moment obtained the next two - I did
enjoy this as a work of fantasy and I’m glad I read it as an example of some of
the best of the genre, but it’s not really the kind of thing that entices me to
read the follow-ups, at least not right now.
