This is the first of my intended Inspector Morse re-read. The technology in use places this
very firmly in time and it matched by an equally dated attitude to women and sex. As you'll 
see from [this article](/articles/article/a-readers-remorse/) it didn't end well but
this first foray is an interesting, now historical, novel. A single text message
would have destroyed the whole premise but the application of actual detection skills
is a nice contrast to the over-reliance on technology of more contemporary fiction.
