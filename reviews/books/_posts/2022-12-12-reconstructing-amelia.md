I listened to this as an audiobook and it pretty much held my attention all the way through. The story of a
fairly wealthy New Yorker and the shocking death of her teenage daughter and the secrets of both her
and her school mates that are revealed, as well the lead characters own background. The final reveal
was perhaps a bit of stretch in terms of coincidence by the plotting and story structure was intriguing
and the description of middle class New York life convincing. A good read (or listen!)
