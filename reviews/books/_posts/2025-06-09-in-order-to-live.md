This month’s reading for my local Book group. A poignant, astonishing and
heartfelt story (I managed not to cry almost until the last page). What an
incredible strong and brave person Yeong-mi is. To have suffered so much yet to
be so determined to still succeed at what she set her mind to and understand
and speak out for the plight of others when she has herself had been so ill
used shows a strength of character that I have seldom encountered. Both
horrific and inspiring, well written, never dull and never sensationalist, even
the most brutal episodes come across as something pretty mundane. She wasn’t
party to any earthshaking events or seismic changes Just acts of casual cruelty
or unlooked for kindness and you can never tell which it would be.
