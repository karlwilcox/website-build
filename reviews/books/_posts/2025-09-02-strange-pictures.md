A strange book with pictures! Easy to read but slightly disturbing to ponder
on. We have four stories of everyday Japanese life, all based round hand drawn
pictures and a mystery. What are the pictures *actually* telling us, beyond
their “face value” visual appearance?

Very cleverly written (and I’m sure the deliberate mystery over the author’s
identity has been a marketing dream!) this is well worthwhile read and not like
anything else I have read before. A brilliant use of the visual medium (and a
really confusing audio book I would imagine!)

I feel a strong need to construct a diagram showing the character
relationships, rather like those found at the start of each of the “Before the
Coffee Gets Cold” series, and I’m surprised that I haven’t been able to find
one with an internet search. If anyone comes across one please let me know!
