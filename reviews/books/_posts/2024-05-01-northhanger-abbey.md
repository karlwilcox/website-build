I read this in my big volume of collected novels and referred to the York Notes Guide for 'A' level students as I 
went along. I enjoyed this, especially with the help of the guide. I think, like all the Austen novels, this will improve 
on every re-read as I will take in more of the references, subtleties and foreshadowing. The story is less 
laugh-out-loud funny than other words (apart from the faux "reveal" at the end but still bitingly satirical and very 
knowing.
