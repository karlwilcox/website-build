This is an excellent history book. Sometimes history concentrate just on the
big themes and the major characters, others try to tell the story by offering
little vignettes of the life of ordinary folk but miss the big picture. Katya
strikes a nice balance, opening each section with the back story and actions of
an ordinary person and their observations and reaction to a major event that is
happening around them. I like this approach and the overall story is a
suprisingly interesting one. The picture painted is not at all bleak (although
I can't help feeling it plays down the influence of the Stasi - after all, it's
head is invariably referred to as "the Hated Mielke") so it punctures the bleak
and grey impression that I certainly had from living through those times and
seeing East Germany potrayed in the news and media. And it was interesting
trying to spot any signs of the impending collapse in the events of the late
1980s (remarkably few, even with the benefit of hindsight).

I certainly have a much better understanding of what happened and also why the
eventual reunification was so challenging, there surely where lessons that West
Germany could have learned from the East, not least in the provision of child
care and role of women in general.

A triumph of historical writing that is a must for anyone interested
in modern European history.
