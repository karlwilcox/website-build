The New York Times reviewed this by comparing it to Ursula Le Guin and this is a valid point, both in the
stylish language and the thoughtful, very human setting. This is about an anthropologist helping the
people she is there just to study. This is a clever story, well written and just as long as needs it
to be (204 pages). There's no unnecessary padding to get this up to a door-stop, or even a regular
sized novel so, which is quite refreshing, and the eBook price does reflect this being a novella,
which is a much better position that other authors who try to price novellas at the same rate as
novels (looking at you Ben...) 

A worthwhile read and another example of the skill and range of Adrian's talents, it is hard to 
pin him down to a particular sub-genre, he is equally adept at all aspects of fantasy and SF.
