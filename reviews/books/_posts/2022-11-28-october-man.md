Listened to this as an audiobook, well read by Sam Peter Jackson. I must say that I really enjoyed this, despite being billed as a
novella this is still pretty long and certainly tells a full story which I loved. I'd like to hear more stories from Germany
and the Abtellung KDA and its agent Vanessa Sommer. The London based series are getting somewhat top heavy with characters
and established lore and canon that is becoming a bit burdensome and plot-restrictive. This was shorter, leaner but also
more narratively free and much the better for it. Great!
