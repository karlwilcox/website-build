On the surface, the story of an architect and the tower that she designs in
Tokyo, but underneath a much deeper meditation on what it means to be a
criminal and how we treat our fellow human beings. There are nicely into woven
stories about the author of the book That led to the building of the tower,,
and of the woman who inspired him and her son who subsequently cross his paths
with the architect.

There is a lot to take in here, this is a thought provoking book that would
probably benefit from rereading, ideally in just one or two settings rather
than the disjoint sessions I was able to give it. I can see why it won awards,
and the translation is excellent, the book reads very well with delightful
clarity and economy of expression.

This is definitely worth your time and detention and something that I would
like to go back to again in the future.
