I'm sure that I enjoyed but trying to update this review a couple of years later I can't
actually recall much about it. All the usual features are there but I didn't get anything
distinctive and my brief notes say it was good but annoyingly incomplete with lots of loose
ends that make this less than a satisfying story. Perhaps due for a re-read.
