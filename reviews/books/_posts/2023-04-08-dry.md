Wow. Even though I'd seen the film this was a gripping read. It arrived on
Friday evening and I'd finished it by Saturday night. So pleased I have the
next three to read too, but going to take a break first as it was kind of
intense! Fantastic story, rich characters, satisfying ending, almost the
perfect Aussie crime read. We met Aaron Falk, financial crimes investigator
with the federal police, however this story is about his own background, crimes
committed long ago and an apparent recent tragedy. The outback, the country
town and the drought itself are all deeply and convinclingly drawn to almost
become characters themselves.

A deserved award winner which I would recommend to anyone as a great
introduction to the genre.
