Wow. Even though I'd seen the film this was a gripping read. It arrived on Friday evening and I'd finished it by Saturday night.
So pleased I have the next three to read too, but going to take a break first as it was kind of intense! 
Fantastic story, rich characters, satisfying ending, almost the perfect Aussie crime read. 
We met Aaron Falk, financial crimes investigator with the federal police, however this story is about
his own background, crimes committed long ago and an apparent recent tragedy. The outback, the country town
and the drought itself are all deeply and convinclingly drawn to almost become characters themselves.

A deserved award winner which I would recommend to anyone as a great introduction to the genre.
