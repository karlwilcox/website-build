Intricately plotted over 3 different timelines involving the founding of a town
and allocation of water rights but I just think that the structure doesn't
really work. The jumping about gets irritating, taking you out of the story and
then there's a massive " information dump" dénouement in the last 20 pages that
all hinges on a very minor character who just happened to be( without any
sign-posting) an ex-army sniper. Too clever for its own good which makes it
quite hard to read.
