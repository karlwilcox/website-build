Intricately plotted over 3 different timelines involving the founding of a town and allocation of water rights but I 
just think that the structure doesn't really work. The jumping about gets irritating, taking you out of the story 
and then there's a massive " information dump" d√©nouement in the last 20 pages that all hinges on a very minor 
character who just happened to be( without any sign-posting) an ex-army sniper. Too clever for its own good which 
makes it quite hard to read.
