Starts as a simple tale of rich sister helping out poor sister with the use of holiday
home in Venice with a few hints of a tradegy in the past. Very soon becomes much more
complicated but in a convincing way, with new information gradually revealed and fairly
believeable responses by the main characters. Moves to a satisfying conclusion that does
explain everything and raises a moral dilemma that mirrors the events from the past.

Clever, well written and never dull. Certainly good enough for me to order another
few books from this author.
