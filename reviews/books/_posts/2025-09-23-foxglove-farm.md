The nice thing about these comfort reads is that we do know that no matter how
bad things get it will all work out happily in the end!

And things get bad largely because people do slightly implausible things,
failed to communicate and generally make bad life decisions. Fortunately,
however, everyone else in the village will rally round and dig you out of
whatever hole you have tossed yourself into.

The story, what it’s worth involves a fair bit of incident, repeatedly stolen
alpacas, barn fires, near marital breakdown, debt, depression and injuries. The
life of a farmer and the farmer’s family is never easy and we do get some
insights to it here, including the need to diversify the income, in this case
by setting up some static caravans and camper vans to offer camping
accommodation.

I’m sure we would all like to live somewhere near love heart Lane, everyone is so
nice there. If all you’re looking for is a undemanding read that but might
actually move you as well as comfort you then you can’t go far wrong with
Christie.
