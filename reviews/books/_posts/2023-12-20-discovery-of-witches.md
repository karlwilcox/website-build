A fantastically rich and detailed story of the competing realms of
witches,daemons and vampires and their struggles against each other and with
the human world. There is an enormous amount of depth here and incredibly
confident writing and storytelling. There is no "you're a wizard Harry‚Äù moment
here, our heroine Diana was raised as a witch and thinks she knows how this
complex world works but her role as an academic historian starts to reveal
hidden secrets and drags her into a conflict between all the races and brings
her closer to Matthew a vampire and the forbidden love that finds them
together.

There are inevitable comparisons with Twilight which I must admit I haven't
read, although I have seen all the films (and the Lego Cullen house) but I do
feel that the world of all souls makes much more sense than the world of
Twilight and as a result the stories are more compelling, the stakes are higher
and I can see why this has been such a success.

Tremendously enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to continuing the
series, I have the set of different coloured but still matching volumes in
paperback.
