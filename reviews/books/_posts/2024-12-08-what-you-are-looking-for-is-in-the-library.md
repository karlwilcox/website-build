With the obligatory (and not especially relevant) cat on the cover this is another
slice of contemporary Japanse life - indeed several slices mildly interconnecting
but all interesting, well drawn and satisfying. All the stories are uplifting and
many of them are inspiring, all driven by the power of books and the unexpected
things that we might find in them. A book about books, reading and readers that
I for one could read over and over again. Delightful.
