Part of an occasional re-read of the Morse books as it is nice sometimes to go back to a world without mobile phones - almost none of these stories would actually happen with todayâ€™s gadgetary and the detection process is totally different! Morse investigates an unsolved disappearance of a school girl (bit of an unhealthy fascination with our Mr. dexter). In this story, Oxford and all the people in it (except Lewis) are much seedier than the TV show, Morse himself has some uncomfortable obsessions. This one had an annoying number of red herrings, some of them a bit unlikely perhaps but
we (and the inspector) get there in the end.
