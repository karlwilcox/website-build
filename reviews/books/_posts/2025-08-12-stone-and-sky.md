The longer this series goes on, and the greater the cast of characters, races
and organisations involved in and aware of the supernatural the less compelling
this becomes, to be honest. The stakes actually seem lower with each new story,
perhaps because there are so many players involved the danger for any one of
them now seems to be reduced. In the first few books it really was just
Nightingale, Peter and Lesley the world and any harm that might befall them
would seriously affect the storyline. Now there are entire armies on both
sides, the whole thing has become less personal and I don’t really care
anymore. What used to be handled by Peter dashing off in the Asbo now involves
an entire convoy of cars, campers and transit vans!

— later —

So despite my reservations in the middle part, I did see his through to the end
and ultimately I did enjoy it, possibly more because of Abigail‘s story thread
rather than Peter's, his we had mostly seen before and if that had been the
only thread this would’ve been just rather derivative of previous books. In the
end though, Abigail‘s adventures and the Scottish setting lifted this enough
for me to say that it is a worthwhile addition to the ever-growing canon of
rivers of London lore.

This was an audiobook and I have fixed the character voices in my head and use
them even when reading now...
