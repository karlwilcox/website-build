On the surface this appears to be a straight-forward list and description of all the places that
Jane Austen lived in; and it does fulfill that initial promise. More however, it is also a
really good biography of Jane herself, explaining the major events of her life and examining
how her surroundings, both domestically within the household and socially within the surrounding
area; influenced her life and writings. And there is nothing dry or dull here, the writing is
lively, interesting and totally fascinating. I could easily recommend this as the first work
to pick up if anyone wanted to go beyond the novels themselves. Great work!
