I listened to this as an audiobook and really enjoyed it. A detective story set
in 1950’s Japan, a world of telegrams, punctual trains and these new-fangled
aeroplanes, and without ubiquitous CCTV, mobile phones or email. It was nice to
have a story that relied on human recollection (and its fallibilities), paper
records and telephone calls.

The language and style was very simple, hardly any description except where the
location was important to the plot and the characters frequently summarised the
deductions so far, which was very helpful.

Ironically with a story this simple few of the characters had much depth or
even back story (it was only five hours after all). I didn’t identify the
actual culprit so that was a good twist and I liked the letter device as the
final chapter which explained everything and brought things to date with the
consequences for all the players.

So this was a short interesting read and I’m a little conflicted – I enjoyed
the immediacy of a short book but I do think that I would have liked to have
known the characters, especially the detectives, a little better.

Clever plotting, simple storytelling, compelling narrative. Would recommend.
