Nice to let DCI Seawoll have a more central role back in his old stomping ground and there are 
some nice scenes here (the crashed airmen for example) and this had all the tropes, jokes
and witty banter that we have come to expect. My main reservation is that after 9 London
based books, not to mention the also-canon novellas and graphic novels we have an
ever-enlarging canvas and increasing cast of characters who are "in the know". ALthough
I enjoyed this I do miss the intimacy of the earlier books with really just the
handful of Folly residents against the (supernatural) world.
