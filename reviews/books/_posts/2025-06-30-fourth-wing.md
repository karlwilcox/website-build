I thought this was pretty ordinary at first, a competent mashup of Harry Potter
and the hunger games with dragons. It was quite blood thirsty but well written
and I did think I had read it all before and wasn’t expecting anything radical.

Studious, physically weak girl expecting to join a community of librarians and
scribes is forced into a military Academy with a high mortality rate. She faces
many challenges but rises to the occasional through strength of character and
sheer determination rather than special powers or prowess.

However, as the book went on, they were hidden depths, new information and new
ideas. And as the romance developed and the characters back stories were filled
out, this became better and better. It was surprisingly raunchy in places (more
than I expected!) And I have to say I genuinely did not see The ending coming,
at least not all of it. I think the “mythical” creatures are quite well
signposted, but I did not see the other big reveal once our heroine wakes up
from the final battle.

I can completely understand why this book has been so popular and I’m looking
forward to the second instalment. There are also some really nice special
editions that I am starting to covet!
