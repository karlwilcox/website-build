I listened to this as an audiobook and quite enjoyed it, but with some reservations.
It had all the usual Goddard features so was a comforting read in that respect but
I j ust felt that the whole premise on which it was based wasn't really convincing.
There's a big house in Cornwall with (surprise) a Panic room built in. Beyond that
to be honest I can't really remember but there was an air of menace about things!
