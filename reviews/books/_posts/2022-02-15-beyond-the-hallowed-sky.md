I think I'd like to re-read this one on actual paper - I listened to it as an audiobook, sometimes while
doing other things and I think I sometimes drifted away because it took quite a while for this
narrative to grab me. I do recall going back to the start of a chapter several times. The basic
premise, receiving a message from your future self was interesting but there are two different
time lines in the story and, so far at least, there doesn't seem to be much tying them together
so it all seems a bit disjoint.

I think there is a good book here, and a strong trilogy and I really need that re-read to
do it proper justice. If I ever get round to it I'll update this review accordingly.
