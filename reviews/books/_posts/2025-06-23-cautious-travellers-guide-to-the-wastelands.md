The Hellbound train runs through Vandermeer‘s southern reach in a beautifully
lyrical novel. All the characters are well drawn and the train and the
wasteland are lovingly described. You have to take this as magical realism
rather than true steampunk so don’t look for explanations or plausibility. This
is a story about characters.

I can see this being frustrating for those that like clear cut explanations and
neatly tied up endings, the conclusion does leave a lot for the reader to
wonder on, but the book is just sufficiently lyrical to be an enjoyable read
but I wouldn’t call it gripping. It was pretty clear from the start that
nothing about the waste land was going to be explained, it was just a vivid,
living canvas for the train to travel through – anything could happen as there
were no rules or constraints (that’s why I gave up on Vandermeer) so you have
to like and care about the characters and enjoy the language descriptions on
their own terms.

Not for everyone, but Sarah has a clear talent and is one to watch.
