I had read most of the Shardlake series and indeed did have the rather dull
looking paperbacks some years ago but which were given away when I was running
low on space. When the whole series was re-issued with very beautiful new
covers, I couldn't resist buying them just to have them on my shelf. They
didn't actually remain there for long as I was sorely tempted to revisit at
least the first in the series. I'm glad that I did, and I enjoyed it just as
much this time as I did the first time.

We have an unusual hero, deformed and rather physically weak but that just
makes the challenges he faces more interesting in their resolution. The story
moves along at a good pace and is populated with well drawn characters and the
period detail seems really comprehensive. The author clearly has a lot of legal
knowledge of the Medieval period and has made it clear here that the
dissolution of the monasteries was much more of a legal process than something
carried out by force. There is a satisfying conclusion and a nicely finished
story that doesn't leave any unnecessary loose ends hanging. I'm not surprised
this has been adapted to television and perhaps we watch the show one day.

I look forward to getting between more of these colourful covers and
rediscovering the rest of Matthewâ€™s adventures.
