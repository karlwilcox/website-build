Fin Macleod is back in the Hebrides bringing a bunch of memories and digging up
yet more long buried island secrets in a quest to rescue his son from a murder
charge. Does every one on the island have a dark and terrible secret? There are
certainly a lot of them to go around.

I did enjoy the Louis trilogy, so this is a welcome return and I finished the
whole thing within a couple of days of purchase. It's really interesting to see
the characters from that original trilogy now middle-aged with grown-up
children. As always with Peter, this is a complex and compelling tale and we
really get inside the characters heads, particularly that of Finn McLeod
himself the story is actually quite bleak in some ways, where Fin and Marsaila
as their son has been accused of murder, but even though this is resolved there
still a lot of pain to go around. Oh, and industrial salmon farming comes in
for quite a beating too…

There are some great callbacks to the original books and the characters from
those, but I just can't help feeling that there is nobody on the islands that
doesn't have some buried secret and there has been an awful lot of death,
tragedy, partner swapping and parental confusion. Nevertheless, this is a great
story, kept me really involved and although I figured out some parts of it the
overall arc fits together really well and there is a satisfying ending.
