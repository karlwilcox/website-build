An earlier work, pre-dating the big "Vera" and "Shetland" successes.
Crime drama set in a small village with a limitec canvas and not a huge cast of
characters. I listened to this as an audiobook and it
was OK. The narrative style is already quite well developed and there is some
human interest in the story arc of the lead character but nowhere near the
league of Jimmy Perez especially. A pedestrian work that I probably would 
not have read if had not had Ann's name on the cover but as noted elsewhere,
the early work was the necessayr grounding for the later big hitters!
