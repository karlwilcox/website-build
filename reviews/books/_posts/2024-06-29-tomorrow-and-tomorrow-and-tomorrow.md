A story of gamers and developers switching in time and place between LA, NY and
MIT. Lovingly drawn characters, clever gaming ideas and a good description of
the game development process. Even with all of this I don't think this deserves
the hype. One reviewer called - "the best book I have ever read"; in which case
they either have a very small library or the rest of the quotation was "---about
PC game developers and their relationships" in which case it is perfectly
correct. An enjoyable read, gripping in parts, just not as good as the cover
blurb makes out.
