I can't imagine the conversation between the author and her agent when pitching the idea!

This was an outside-my-comfort-zone read for my local bookclub and I am so glad that
I did and want to thank my fellow members for voting this one in.

Set in the north-west coast of the US in an imaginary town that reminded me a lot of
Eagle Harbor on Bainbridge Island that I've visited a few times. This is a charming
and brilliantly clever story, carefully crafted, beautiful straight forward writing
and populated by wonderful characters that you really cared for (especially
Marcellus, the octopus himself!)

The climatic perils exeperienced by the main characters in their own particular
ways were mercifully brief (I don't like books that really string you along
before getting the payoff that we want and expect) 
and there is a poignant but ultimately happy ending for all involved.

Well done book club for choosing a remarkably clever story.
