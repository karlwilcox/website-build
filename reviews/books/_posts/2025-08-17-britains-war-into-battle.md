A superb work of scholarship that gives a new and fascinating insight into what
Britain was really like during the initial stages of the second world war. This
combines social history from diary entries and survey findings with the
political story, leaving the military history largely in the background.

There is much here that was new to me, such as the enormous (and not
particularly effective) diplomatic effort to get America to enter the war, or
at least turn its industrial might towards arming Britain and Russia. Not
entirely surprising given the rather underhanded way Churchill wanted to
maintain Britain’s hold on its empire and Imperial preference in trade. There
were also interesting insights into the always fragile relationship with Russia
and the contortions necessary to support a communist regime without encouraging
socialism at home.

I was also surprised to see how soon after the war began that debate and
planning was taking place about how things would be done after the war.
Certainly once the threat of a German invasion of the British mainland had
receded there seemed to be this unshakeable faith that the war _would_ end and
that there be a country (and an empire) still there to be continued with. This
seems strange to me, but then I suppose that most those involved had already
lived through the first war, which, despite the appalling loss of life was
never the “total” war that affected home life as did the second.

The author choses to break his volumes at the twin shocks of Pearl Harbor and
the loss of Force Z near Singapore, which seems a sensible decision as this
does represent a real changing point, at least for Britain. The next volume is
high on my list for reading soon.
