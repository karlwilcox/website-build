This was strange but ultimately it must have been good since I did read it to
the end! All the way through I wasn't really sure where this was going, there
seemed to be arc as such, and the only character who developed in any way was
Penny, and even then only in terms of learning the ropes.

Everyone else appeared fully formed and stayed that way. As a "slice of life"
mood piece this works well, and is sometimes uplifting but you pretty much end
up exactly where you started from. I understand that this is a duology but
there's nothing outstanding. or left to be resolved as far as I can make out.
Expect more of the same perhaps?
