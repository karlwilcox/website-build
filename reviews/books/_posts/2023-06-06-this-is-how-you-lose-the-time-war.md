This was lovely, and probably more cleverly constructed than I realised at the
time. Iâ€™m sure if you plotted out the timeline it all fits together beautifully
this is a lyrical romance between two people on opposite sides of a war,
travelling through time to accomplish largely unstated military , but actually
communicating their increasing feelings for each other. The war itself is very
much just a backdrop and a vehicle to explain the time travelling and this is
only really science-fiction in the sense that it uses one of the genres main
tropes as a story mechanic. This is really a love story that plays out over
infinite time. Beautifully written and surprisingly moving, a fairly short book
that does not overstay its welcome, every scene is both necessary and
delightful. A very clever piece of work indeed.
