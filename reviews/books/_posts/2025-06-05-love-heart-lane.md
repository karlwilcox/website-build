This was easy reading at its finest, set in a Highland village in probably
connected to the rest of Scotland only by a bridge and mountain Path. Not the
only implausible thing in this novel (crowd-funding a replacement bridge?) But
in the end none of this really matters. This was a lovely undemanding read with
little unnecessary padding and in which a surprising amount happens. There is
inevitable happy ending, but also plenty of interesting characters for us to
learn more about as the series progresses. I was glad to find most of the
series as the Amazon deal of the day and will work my way through them whenever
Iâ€™m in need of a comfort read.
