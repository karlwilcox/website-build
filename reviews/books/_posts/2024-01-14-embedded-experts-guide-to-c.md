‘C’ was the first “proper” programming language that I learned myself (shortly
after being taught Pascal in 1982) and I still like it for its simplicity- you
can see its influence in so many modern languages. I’m also hoping to use it
for some of my electronics projects to program micro-controllers and I have
already identified a tool chain to compile to the Z80 board that I am building.
Hence when I saw this I thought it would be a good refresher for the language
and interesting to see what a professional practitioner would say about the
language.

And I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this book, it was
interesting, clearly written with very little padding and several useful code
snippets. It covered many topics beyond basic programming of particular
interest to the embedded systems practitioner, things like memory management,
interrupts And runtime support systems. I can highly recommend this to anyone
in the field and I think that I should at least skim through it again before
undertaking any serious micro processor programming.
