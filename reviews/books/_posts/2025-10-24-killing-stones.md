Jimmy Perez is back! And it was good to see him. This was very much a two
handler, with Jimmy and his wife and investigative partner Willow working
together to solve the case, and it was even better for it as we got to see two
views on everything that was happening.

The only slightly off note was the introduction of Jimmy‘s best friend of whom
we had never heard before, but once you get past that this is a good story.
There is plenty of plausible misdirection and as usual, we get a real glimpse
into the life of The Scottish Islands.

Jimmy’s best friend is found dead battered around the head by an ancient relic.
Suspects arise, and further atrocities are committed, all in the days running
up to Christmas with the rest of Scotland paralysed by winter storms Jimmy and
Willow are largely left to their own devices.

A are welcome return in a clever story, well told and easy to listen to with
our usual audible narrator.
