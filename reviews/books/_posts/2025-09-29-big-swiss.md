Another book club read that drags me out of my comfort zone into something that
I would be unlikely to pick up otherwise.

We had a long break over the summer, which was useful as it took me a long time
to read this! Not because it is bad - the construction and structure is very
clever whereby we follow only the inner life of Greta, just that single point
of view. However (and this is the clever bit), Greta works as a transcriber for
the town sex therapist and so knows everyone else’s inner secrets. We are shown
many of these transcripts so we get insights both into Greta and into the love
interest (Big Swiss of the title). Even cleverer we get Greta’s reactions to
hearing the inner thoughts as revealed in the transcripts. And where that
conceit isn’t quite sufficient we fall back on Greta listening to gossip to
find out what goes on beyond our protagonist’s point of view. I did
particularly like the idea that the gossips she overhears actually turn out to
be unreliable narrators, as in much of real life they often are!

But to (finally!) explain why this took so long to read, it was because almost
every interaction was quick-fire, witty, disorientating, and sometimes
deliberately confusing (did Greta say that out loud, or did she just think
it?). And that takes some concentration to read and I just couldn’t keep up the
necessary focus for extended periods of time. I had to come up for air every so
often and would then be distracted by something else, putting the book aside
for a while.

Ultimately though, yes, I did enjoy it, it has genuinely stretched my
boundaries and did entertain me. It isn’t neatly tied up with a bow and ended
in a satisfying fashion - certainly our heroine has moved on with some part of
her life, as has the love interest, but there are still unknowns, unanswered
questions and ongoing stories - just like life then!
