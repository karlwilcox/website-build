A kind of steampunk fantasy, our hapless hero takes his betrothed to visit,
vast edifice with some resemblance to the tower of Babel. Things start badly
when almost instantly he is separated from both his belongings and his fiancee
and must enter the tower to try and find her. Each of the lower floors is
carefully described and although apparently nonsensical do eventually come
together as essential parts of the towerâ€™s functioning. Our hero doggedly
pursue his goal gradually becoming less of a bumbling *ingenue* and more of a
seasoned denison of the tower.

I enjoyed this, sent in himself starts out as a rather unsympathetic character
being, to be honest a bit of a dick, but he grows into his role and into our
hearts and we begin to root for him. The tower itself is well described and
quite fascinating, and a genuine (if not totally plausible) attempt is made to
explain the purpose and function of everything. So an enjoyable read and I did
rapidly move on to the second in the series.
