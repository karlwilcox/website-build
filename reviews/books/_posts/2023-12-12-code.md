I read the first edition of this a few years after it came out and enjoyed it
at the time, so seeing this as a cheap deal on the Kindle was a nostalgic read
for me. Having had a fairly good computer site education followed by practical
experience I don't think I actually learned anything significantly new from
reading this but it is an excellent and rather comforting summary of the
knowledge that you already have. (a bit like the hobbits enjoying their family
trees with everything they already know laid out neatly in front of them).

I can also see this being a really useful read for the interesting non-specialist.
It does actually explain everything in a sensible order, building on simple
concepts up to the idea of computer code and covers a lot of hardware concepts
as well. This is more of a popular science book than a technical work but
perhaps better for it in that respect.
