A nicely twisty crime story. Four girls in a car on the way home from
a night club crash on a lonely road. When the badly injured driver
awakes the other three are gone. Twenty years later a BBC journalist
arrives to make a podcast and finds the town and its inhabitants full
of secrets - almost everyone has something to hide.

Cleverly plotted with a sub-story that initially seems unrelated but
some (all too) convenient renaming of some of the characters ties them together.
The story moves along a terrific pace with not a wasted page. The characters
were nicely drawn and the premise was intriguing and well executed. Best
read in just one or two sittings if you can. 

I really enjoyed this one, well done Claire!
