I listened to this as an audiobook (because these work out a lot cheaper than buying
the actual book if you get the 24 credit deal) and as usual the narration was top notch.
As for the story, I'm always happy to hear more about Abigail and this was a nice, low
level, low stakes tale of supernatural police procedure. Not adding a whole lot to the
canon but an enjoyable story.
