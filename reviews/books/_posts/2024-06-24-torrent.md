A debut Australian police procedural. There was a good main character who is
flawed and fallible but because of a plausible family situation not some dark
secrets from a hidden past! The other characters were much less well drawn, her
boss especially came across as one-dimensional but the story was good with
plenty of interesting twists and turns. A promising start and I will look out
for any sequels
