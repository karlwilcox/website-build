We are back in the wild outback again and boy does it feel remote here. Another lovely little
map in the frontispiece sets the scene for a complex but ultimately satisfying tale - a bit 
like a locked-room mystery but down a mine-shaft.  The book is infused with flawed, realistic
characters and absolutely oozing with atmosphere and a sense of place. Chris is well on form
here.
