Wow! This was great. An exciting and gripping story of Feyre who accidentally kills a faerie creature
and is forced to do penance in the land of faerie itself, gradually getting to know the (sad) history
of the land and the Faerie Lord she is bound to. Easy to read, moving along at a fast pace and quite
graphic and bloodthirsty in places. High tragedy at its finest, along with a twisted love story.

Half way through, once Feyre had returned home I genuinely had no idea where the story would go
but was really keen to find out! Pretty shocking and painful ending all round. Eager to read
the rest of the sequence. Nice colourful covers too, looks great on the shelf!
