This is the third novel featuring Martin Scarsden, an Australian journalist. One of the problems
of writing a crime series where the main protagonist is NOT a policeman is getting them involved
in the actual investigation at such a level to make an impact and allow us the reader to follow
the action. Chris managed this in the first two but I felt that this was by far the weakest
of the three. Martin Scarsden has no real agency here (since he has no investigatory authority)
and although there is a reasonably good story here we only learn of it because one character
after another explains the plot to Martin!

I don't regret reading this but to be honest I'm glad the series with Martin is ending here and I look 
forward to following the career of Ivan Lucic, an actual cop (kinda proves my point there...)
