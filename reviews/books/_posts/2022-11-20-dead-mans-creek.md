So it turns out that a major character from the previous book has a family with a
**really** complicated backstory! And they cross paths with the secret agent from
the early books! What are the chances...?

Slight lack of credibility aside this yet another complex story with a great sense
of place (still loving the little maps), Nell returns to her home town where new
evidence on a cold case is (literally) uncovered when a damn bursts. And even
the presence of the dam and the reason for its existence is an integral part 
of the story (told you it was complex). But it is also clever and a damn good
read that I got through in just a few days and would happily read the whole
series again. TV adaptation please!
