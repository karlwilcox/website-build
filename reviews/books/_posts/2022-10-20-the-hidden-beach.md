A very convincing Swedish setting (the hundreds of islands in the bays around Stockholm) and a nice description of Swedish summer activities anchor this story well in its 
geographical location. (Much) less convincing is the back-story of our male lead character but such is the price we pay for a satisfactory ending!
 
I listened to this as an audiobook and enjoyed it. I don't think I'd want to hear or read it again particularly but I can recommend it to anyone who wants 
some fun and a warm feeling and not too much peril in their entertainment.
