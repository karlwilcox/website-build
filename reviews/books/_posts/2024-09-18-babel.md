Very much a book of stages - the first stage was a good start, yet another alternative vision of Oxford (someone could
write a book on literary versions of Oxford) which was well drawn and interesting but then things started to drag.
It became slow  then and I actually abandoned it for a while. It still seemed slow when I resumed it (that trip to
Canton and back almost felt like it was told in real-time) but then at about the 70% mark it (almost literally)
exploded into life and action and I had to spend the rest of the day finishing the book. And what a stunning
ending it was! (No spoilers here).

So we have a story about a language translation institute using the power of words and silver to underpin
the British Empire of Edwardian times (it all sort of makes sense once you read it). We follow Robin Swift
from this birth in Canton to this nicely described alternative Oxford and learn of his friends and his
live there.

One the one hand this can appear like a rather heavy handed allegory or some sort of deconstruction of
colonialism, and I guess it is, but it is a cracking story if you have the will power to see it through
to the end. A deserved award winner.
