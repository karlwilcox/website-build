I really enjoyyed this and found myself wanting to come back to it ahead of any
"required" reading, like for the upcoming book club meeting. It tells us of
Tokyo pawn shop that cannot be found except for those that made an
ill-considered life choice and wish to exchange their regrets with the pawn
broker. What they must give up becomes clear near the end of the book but
the process is of vital importance to the dream world that lies beyond
the door of the shop.

It starts as a mystery, when the shop is ransacked and the pawn broker
disppears on the day his daughter is due to take over. As she is about
to set off in pursuit a physicist Keisen appears and self-lessly
offers to help. A love story then develops as they investigate and pursue
her father through the dream world.

I won't say any more but the story is full of incident, drama and marvellous
imagination - you will learn how bags are really supposed to work and
the fastest way to travel is by rumour, after all, nothing travels
faster than a rumour! It is peopled by fascinating characters, many of
whom have a life affirming outlook that we could all learn from
(I've added a couple of passages to my personal "inspirations"
notebook).

A wonderful, moving story, and had I not finished it in the middle of
a busy coffee shop I would have cried at the ending. A delight.
