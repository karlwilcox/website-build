Frankly, this was an astonishing read! This is so accomplished - clearly the
work of a very intelligent and extremely well read young woman. The stories
themselves are not especially sophisticated and largely exist to poke fun
at something (or someone) and to express an opinion. The history
of England is in itself a genuinely funny work. Elsewhere there are some mighty
long paragraphs but the langauge is accomplished and polished and we can
clearly see the future novels having their genesis here. Well worth a
read for any genuine Austenite to get a fully rounded sense of Jane and
just what a talent for words she had from a very early age.
