I sometimes feel that the novellas in this series are a bit of a cash-in since the paperback is near full priced
but only half-paged but in the depths of winter I used one of my Audible credits to get a comfort read. And, yes, 
it was comforting - as you'd expect from the length it is tightly focussed and well told. Foxes are clearly
the coolest animals in London.

Update: I can't actually recall much about the story which is nice as it gives the opportunity for a re-read or re-listen!
