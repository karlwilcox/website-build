The very (even more than usual) political one (as in terms of involving politicians). It has all the
usual great lines, including some zingers from both Jackson Lamb and the narrator. The plot involves
a missing government expert, who is then confused with Shirley in rehab. The timeline is complex,
the story being told in a combination of real-time and flashback with it being left up to the
reader to figure out which is which. It also fills in some of the missing parts from the previous
book (as noted in my review) so yes, taken as a pair I'm happy to report that these two books
show Mick as back on top form!
