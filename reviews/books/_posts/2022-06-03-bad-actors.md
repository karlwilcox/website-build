The very (even more than usual) political one (as in terms of involving
politicians). It has all the usual great lines, including some zingers from
both Jackson Lamb and the narrator. The plot involves a missing government
expert, who is then confused with Shirley in rehab. The timeline is complex,
the story being told in a combination of real-time and flashback with it being
left up to the reader to figure out which is which. It also fills in some of
the missing parts from the previous book (as noted in my review) so yes, taken
as a pair I'm happy to report that these two books show Mick as back on top
form!
