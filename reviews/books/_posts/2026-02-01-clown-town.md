I’ve actually read all the slow horses books but don’t seem to have gotten
around to reviewing them, so it seems slightly odd to be reviewing the most
recent one first.

It has to be said that if you have read all the previous books then there is
absolutely nothing in this one that you haven’t already seen before. All of our
familiar characters are there, both inside and outside Slough House (only the
“Brains Trust” of superannuated spooks is really new) and all of the familiar
situations re-occur. This might be a comfort to the reader or a bit of a
disappointment for anyone expecting something genuinely new.

Since this does reprise many of the earlier works you will not be surprised to
find that the problems we face are almost entirely of the Security Services own
making, with their past actions (both collectively and individually) coming
back to bite them. There is more effort here to keep the Slough House gang all
together and equally involved in the action but I can’t help feeling that this
is largely for the purpose of including much sarcastic banter between the
characters, which does fill much of the book, perhaps to excess.

For what it’s worth, the story involves a retired team who used to manage a
rather unpleasant IRA informant and the equally unpleasant things that they did
at the time. No secret is ever truly buried of course, and no revealed secret
ever goes to waste as someone can try to leverage it for their own purpose,
which First Desk does, although that doesn’t go well, thanks to the somewhat
unexpected intervention of the entire slow horses team.

Overall this is a pretty downbeat story, almost bleak in fact. Lamb's vow
to "burn the whole place down" is fulfilled to excess by the end of the book.

That’s not to say that I didn’t enjoy it, but it doesn’t really break any new
ground and certainly doesn't spaek any joy. For completists only I feel.
