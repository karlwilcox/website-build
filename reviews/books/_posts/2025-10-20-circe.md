This was another Book Club read and turned out to be far better than I
expected. After all, what's interesting about some minor deity who gets exiled to
a deserted island all by herself? And indeed, the book did start with the
feeling that it was just named dropping greek Gods and Titans but I have to
admit that before very long, I was completely hooked and fascinated to see
where it was going. I had no idea what would happen next or how things might be
resolved.

At the end I initially felt that men had generally got a fairly bad press in
this story, none of them were great and many of them behaved quite appallingly,
however on reflection I realise that one of the strengths of this book is that
nobody comes out anywhere near perfect and all the characters are flawed in
someway. An interesting exercise in shrinking God in down to the status of
mankind and also making a distinction between a "hero" and a "good person".
We often conflate the two (Aragorn being a clear example) but really a "hero"
is someone who performs heroic deeds (beyond the abilities of most people) but
that says nothing about their morals.

A thought porovoking work that was beautifully written, marvellously descriptive
and unlike anything I had
read before. I'm so glad I've read this and would urge everyone to join a Book
Club or reading group if they can as it will undoubtedly broaden their
horizons, just as mine have.
