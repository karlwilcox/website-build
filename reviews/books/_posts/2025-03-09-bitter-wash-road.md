To be honest I read a lot of Australian crime novels and after a time they do blur a bit! I didn't
help myself with this one by dropping it for a few months and forgetting who everyone was by the time
I picked it up again... This was wrong of me as it deserved better! I did eventually finish it, after
buying the next few in the series as Amazon Kindle deals of the day but do forgive me if I'm a bit
vague on the plot details.

I did like this, "Hirsch" is a demoted cop banished to a backwater town after being associated with
(but not actually being involved in) a bunch of crooked cops in the big city. The details of small town
outback life, and the role of the local policeman are nicely captured. Unlike a detective assigned to a
single case our hero must deal with multiple overlapping crimes at a greater or lesser degree of crisis.
The main mystery here is a murder, who may or may not be connected to some killers on the loose. There's
a lot going on here and the story moves along nicely. The outback, as is often the case, becomes a
character itself.

Overall, a great police procedural with rounded (and flawed) characters and a town that really springs
to life from the pages. It will be interesting to see whether this ever gets dramatised like so much
else that I've been reading.
