I really enjoyed this book. There is plenty of detail, interesting facts and a
great story. I personally might have like to see a few more code samples but
this is a story of some **very** clever people doing something far in advance
of what the technology was initially capable of. 

We learn about the development of the hardware, robust enough (physically and 
electrically) to survive in the harsh space environment. I particularly liked
the neat idea of add a shift operation when your command addressing space is
already full - just arrange for a particular memory location to implement a
one-bit right shift on the data written. Read it back and you have  your shift
operation!

And then on top of that we get the clever programs, the well thought out
user interace and the interaction with physical instruments and ground
computers. In effect there is also an early "virtual machine" implementation
here as well.

Great stuff for space technology nerds!
