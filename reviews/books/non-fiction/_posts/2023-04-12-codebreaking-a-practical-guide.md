I thought this might inspire me to start writing some code and do my code breaking but it didn’t really. The material is interesting enough, engagingly written with fascinating background stories but the actual process of code breaking is largely just brute force, cribs or variations of frequency analysis and you can just download all the code for that anyway!
I'm really not sure that I would have anything useful to add to the field or get much from re-developing what already exists probably much better than I could do it...

Not the fault of authors, who do a good job of fulfilling the premise of the book it just didn't work out the way that I was looking for.
