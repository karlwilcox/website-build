An extraordinary story of how benevolent corporations used to act and how much they could achieve. As always I 
wanted more technical detail but much of the actual documentation is preserved on the internet if I really wanted to look it 
up. There was a somewhat downbeat ending as Lyons (and the UK in general) loses its lead but that has happened in 
many areas. A fascinating glimpse of IT, business and social history.
