I've listened to this audiobook of a lecture series several times and enjoyed
it each time, gaining new insights on each re-hearing.

It is a general introduction to the works of Tolkien and the historical Western
literature that lies behind them. It does a good job of explaining of how that
literature, and Tolkien's academic work with that literature informed and
drove the creation of the works, and of the idea of middle earth and the
entire legendarium.

Later parts of the course also examine the impact the work has had on modern
culture and how it continues to do so, so many years after its publication
and even more years after its first conception.

I would recommend this as an ideal introduction for anyone who has read
any of the middle earth books (or seen the films) and wants a start on
the wider world of Tolkien scholarship and study, and the rest of his work.

The presentation is, as always, engaging and the Professor speaks with
great (and well earned) authority.
