Abroad in Japan-Chris Broad First impressions are good, with some excellent
cover artwork, which they later ruined by recolouring (my image above is the
German version which retains the colour scheme I have). The first half was
really interesting, about the life of a foreigner in backwater Japan. But the
second half was a much less interesting story of someone becoming a successful
YouTube vlogger who just happens to live in Japan. An honest story but it
didn't need or gain from the vlogging stuff.
