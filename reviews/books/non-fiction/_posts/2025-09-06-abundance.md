Bigger print and plenty of whitespace make this book physically more imposing
than it really needs to be, perhaps a deliberate attempt to give it more
“weight“!

It is a very American exploration of what is currently “wrong” with our
approach to progress (in many fields) and I think many of these failings can be
more widely applied elsewhere in the western world (such as the UK).

The book paints a good picture of the *results* of an alternative approach,
seeing abundance, growth and progress as good things that improve lives, and
the environment and make a good case that a “de-growth” strategy is something
of a doom loop. One thinks irresistibly of the Culture’s description of its own
past as the “Age of Scarcity” in Iain M. Banks novels, and that does seem to be
very much where we are now.

What is less well laid out in the book is a real plan (or even much in the way
of concrete actions) to actually change mindsets and do something that can
achieve all those worthwhile goals. Even so, it is a worthwhile read just to
lay out what might be possible and portray an optimistic future of general
betterment rather than a right wing view of limited resources going to the
highest bidder. Perhaps the hopeful antidote against the miserabalist worldview
that it is hard to avoid these days.
