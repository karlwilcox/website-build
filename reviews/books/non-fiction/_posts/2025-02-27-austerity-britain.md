A triumph of scholarship and entertainment. The research work that has gone into this
history is just astounding - the author draws on a huge range of sources including
newspapers, books, pamphlets, academic research, market research and personal diaries and brings
it all together in a fantastically entertaining fashion. I have to say that that nowhere
in these 430 pages was I bored, every page was interesting.

In a strange way I find history of this nature quite comforting - everything is neatly
laid out and explained with the benefit of hindsight and I already knew the big themes
so it was the tiny details of daily, political and cultural life that was so interesting.

Also, even though this was all a long time ago my own history intersects with some of the
young people in this story, although they were considerably older by the time that I knew
of them!

I'm really looking forward to the remaining three meaty volumes and I'm glad that I've
offered them shelf space. Well done Mr. Kynaston!
