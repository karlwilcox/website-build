I've read this twice now and really enjoyed it. It is quite a substantial read, more than
500 pages but so well written and engaging that it seems shorter. It covers more than just
written work (all that is the primary focus), and reaches far back into history whilst
offering a broad survey of most writers of the genre in English, with regular excursions
into other languages.

Always good to hear our own favourites being mentioned and a great source of ideas
for future reading. It's dangerous for your wallet to read this with a book-buying app
at your side!

Oh, and the cover looks an awful lot like it was created with the quirky graphics
package "Bryce"...
