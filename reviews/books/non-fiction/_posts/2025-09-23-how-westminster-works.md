Ian is a gifted writer who is able to explain arcane and complex concepts in a
way that she’s both simple and engaging. This book could so easily have been
written as a polemic, purely with the intention of making it leadership angry
but in fact it simply lays things out in a fairly straightforward fashion and
lets us draw our own conclusions.

There is a lot that one could get angry about in the British political system
that also explains the steps that were taken to get us here and how little of
it was actually by design but more historical accident.

The final chapter of potential solutions is surprisingly upbeat and quite
positive, suggesting that we don’t need huge changes but that there are many
small improvements that could be made if only we had the will.

This is an excellent book that should be compulsory reading not only for
everyone interested in politics that would also benefit anyone who considers
themselves an active citizen of the country. A deserved best seller.
