A solid academic work that surveys the existing field of research, synthesises it
and adds another layer, extending the field somewhat. An interesting read, especially
the survey of prior art (including a useful review of fictional depictions)
but the end result (the actual urban plan) I would have
like to see a bit more detail on - only one of the twelve chapters actually
contained information on "The First City" and many of the diagrams were
reproduced with unreadably small text, reducing the city plan to little
more than differently sized domes connected by lines indicating transit
tunnels.

Some of the other diagrams were a bit redundant also (do we actually need a
diagram to illustrate what is meant by providing 60cm of space between adjacent
pedestrians?), but the renderings of the proposed architecture by one of
the author's grad students were nicely done.

Worth reading for anyone interested in Mars colonisation but more for the
background presented than the solution offered.
