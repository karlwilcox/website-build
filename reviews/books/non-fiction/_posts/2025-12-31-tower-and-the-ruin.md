I have this on audiobook as I think Professor Drout is such an engaging speaker
that I would listen to him read out my shopping list. In the event I’m glad I
did this as it has a surprisingly personal account in places and being read in
the author’s own voice made it especially moving.

This is a triumph of a book, I have seldom been quite so moved by a supposedly
academic book but also feel that there are some deep and insightful
observations about Tolkien’s work and his source material. I noted several
things that I had not read elsewhere such as the real meaning of Aragorn’s
final words to Boromir and I intend to listen again and see what else is new.

It inspires me to read, yet again, _The Lord of the Rings_ and hopefully with
refreshed eyes.
