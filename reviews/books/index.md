Although most books have an entry of their own there are some that I didn't have a great deal to say
about so these are included in the [mini-reviews](/reviews/shorts/) which I create every quarter. You can
use the [Search Page](/search/) to find a specific title, or scroll through the complete list of
[short review titles](/reviews/shorts/titles/).
