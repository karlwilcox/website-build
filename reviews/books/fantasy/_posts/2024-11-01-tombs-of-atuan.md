A brave and confident a brave and confident move to begin the sequel to a
beloved book by using a setting we are completely unfamiliar with and not even
introducing our favourite character until almost halfway through, merely
glimpsed through a hole in the roof of the labyrinth. Another richly detailed
and immersive setting, demonstrating just how diverse the islands of Earthsea
are.

This is another great piece of work by Ursula and move the story along well, I
wonder how far in advance she had the series planned out, and whether the
children we encountered in the previous book were already in mind for their
vital role in the sequel.
