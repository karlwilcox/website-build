This was a re-read from a few years back triggered by the purchase of what I thought were the next three
so I did some revision before reading...

Story of a London curio dealer with magical powers to see possible futures (a bit like Paul Mua'dib then) but
set in well realised magical miliuex in the modern world. Some interesting characters and the story moved along
well enough, lots of powerful forces at work which our hero Alex needs to negotiate with and around and quite
a lot of action scenes. So yes, on the face of this I did enjoy it but...

It turns out that the books I bought cheap from Oxfam were not sequels that concluded but something books
seven, eight and nine of a twelve (12!) volume series. At that point I had to make a decision - did I actually
want to invest my money and time in buying the missing volumes and reading the next eleven? So the first book
was fine, but just fine enough for the answer to be "yes".

I donated the unread volumes back to Oxfam and considered the money I paid for them as a donation! Perhaps the
moral of the story is to do your research and not impulse buy!
