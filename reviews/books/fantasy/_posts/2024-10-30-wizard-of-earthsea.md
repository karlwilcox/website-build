A re-read after probably 40 years but a suprising amount had stayed with me,
in particular the naming of the dragon, although I had mis-remembered that
episode as the climax.

This story is just steeped in atmosphere, the storm lashed isles of Earthsea
surround the reader the tang of salt is always in the air and the cold winds
ruffle our hair.

A great story with a flawed and fallible hero that we still root for. A deserved
masterwork of the genre. Must get around to watching the Ghibli film version.
