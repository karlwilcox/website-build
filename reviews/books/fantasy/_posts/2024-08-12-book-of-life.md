This was a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, and a considerable improvement
on the middle Book. Our hero heroine increased our powers considerably, in all
sorts of ways and with the assistance or family members, but this was balanced
by the array of powerful forces arranged against her.

I really like the idea of the long lived powerful family, like the Cullens but
with more financial acumen. I liked the development of the Book itself as a
character and the way it revealed the deceptions of the congregation was deftly
handled, this is indeed a very well realised world and I'm not surprised that
the author has sufficient material for the supplementary volume (on my list to
acquire, but quite expensive).

I'm happy with the ending, it is a new world that our characters are entering,
and our heroine has responsibilities that will stretch and exercise her
considerable powers. I don't think she is fated for a quiet life, but I'm sure
she is up to the job.

So overall, despite the disappointment of volume 2, I really like the trilogy
overall and may try to find time to watch the TV adaptation as well.
