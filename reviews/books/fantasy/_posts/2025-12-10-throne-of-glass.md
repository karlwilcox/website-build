Perhaps the founding document of modern romantasy and certainly most of the
features that we expect from the genre are already present. There’s no real
raunchiness yet (our heroine is but still a teenager after all) but perhaps the
weakest aspect is the pacing. Following the set up and journey to Rifthold
things slow down a lot as we crawl our way through the early rounds, only for
things to get really interesting once the ghost of Queen Elena turns up. But
then we are back to the grind and events drag for both the characters and the
reader. We’ve just had the yuletide ball, heavily trailed as being of great
significance but nothing actually happened. More action please!

I've never finished the book, and although I can certainly see the attraction
of the story this is not the fully formed peak of romantasy that Sarah produced
later on. The story is a bit flabby, the characters are a bit wooden, with
unclear motivations (perhaps deliberately for example in the case of the king,
but it still doesn't make for easy or compelling reading) The fantasy elements
are fairly pedestrian, there’s no new ground being broken here, nd the actual
“romance” is both caste and quite low-key.

The story doesn't really stand on its own at all and perhaps I am doing an
injustice by reviewing it before reading at least some more of the series but
that's the way I chosen to do things! I will read on – I have a lovely matching
set of all eight volumes, and you know how much I love matching sets… Let's see
how it progresses from here.
