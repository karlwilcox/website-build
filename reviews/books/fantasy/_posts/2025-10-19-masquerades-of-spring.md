Obviously having read my review of “Stone and Sky”Ben has taken a note of my
complaint about the overloading of characters and backstory in that novel and
produced something much more tightly focused in this novella.

Our only familiar character here is Nightingale, and we go back in time to
1930s New York and the height of the jazz era. We also meet a contemporary of
Thomas, who also studied at Casterbrook and is nicely realised by the narrator.
There is a low stakes story of enchanted musical instruments and a fun range of
recognisable character tropes as our two protagonists try to trace these
instruments to their source.

In some ways this was a bit of a self-indulgence by the author to stretch his
range and bring to life a foppish and gay minor British aristocrat marooned in
New York, and indeed this character was brilliantly realised by the narrator of
the audiobook version.

Overall, this was an enjoyable little tale, not adding much to the canon (which
is already top heavy according to my previous reviews!) And I did like the
call-out to Molly and others of her kind that provided a nice link back to the
original Books.

Harmless fun booked worth a read (or, even better a listen).
