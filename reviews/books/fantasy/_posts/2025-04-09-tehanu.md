Just beautiful to read, lyrical text describing a simple story of a quiet life and goings-on
in a small island far from the centre of things. Just a delight to read. On the one hand
a straight-forward pastoral fantasy on the other a meditation on the roles and strengths
or women and men. An unexpected direction to take from the first book but shows the
strength and range of the author. Delightful and moving.
