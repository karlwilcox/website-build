What a marvellous story! This might be aimed at pre-teens but there are adult
focussed authors who could learn a lot from Diana. Plotting, pacing, characters
and description are all exemplary and the twist at the end I really did not see
coming!

I really liked the character of Cat – long suffering but always trying to do
the right thing, even if that just seems to dig him deeper into a hole of
trouble.

All the other characters are well drawn and have surprising depth for a
relatively short book – I’m tempted to describe many of them as “Dickensian”,
and not only in their mode of dress.

There’s clearly a whole world (dozens, in fact) to be explored in future books
but the nice thing about Charmed Life is that it is complete and satisfying as
it stands – the sequels flow from the threads laid down but they are not the
primary concern, the story of Cat/Eric is.

This was so good that I wish I had some easily available young relatives that I
could read it to. I bought this as part of matching set of all the series,
along with the three “Howl” books and I’m looking forward to reading all of
them although I see that the recommended reading order is not the same as the
publication so I’ll be going back to “The Lives of Christopher Chant” next.

Finally, high praise for the lovely David Frankland covers and the extra
material at the end.
