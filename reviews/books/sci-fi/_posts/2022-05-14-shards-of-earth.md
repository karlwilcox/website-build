The start of an excellent, intricate space with a good, interesting cast of characters, locations and
a good back story that sets up an interesting universe for us to explore. Intially we
start out following Idris, whose genetically enhanced telepathic skills are now
redundant following the end of the war and the disappearance of the planet shattering architects.
Or are they really gone? Sufficient depth to bear
re-reading, which I should do some time and hence be able to tell you more about this one...
