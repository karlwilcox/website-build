Well, four door-stop volumes into my great Dune re-read I'm finally starting to flag a little.
It is still immersive and all the politics, intrigue and machinations are still there, along
with some of the original characters but for most of the book we just hear about Leto II
and how much of a d*ck he appears to be. I might take a rest for a while but expect the
warm desert winds to drag me back sooner or later.
