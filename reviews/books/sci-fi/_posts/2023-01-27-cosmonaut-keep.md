I'm re-reading this in preparation for tackling the whole series. This is a pleasant,
low stakes story that sets things up in an interesting way but doesn't have a massive
impact (no big reveals or dramatic flourishes). This may be why I didn't take it
any further when I first read it quite a while back. Enjoyable enough but very
much a first step on a longer road.
