The usual mind-expanding themes that we have come to expect from Stephen, in this case an ever-expanding series of multi-verses to get to
grips with! Despite the infinities of the topic the story itself is quite small scale with just a few characters and for most of the
story some very constrained locations. This inevitably needs to more "talk" than "action", which isn't necessarily a bad thing
(I quite like the problem-solving aspects) but this isn't a novel of page-turning excitement. The appearance of the randomly
loquacious black sphere called 'Terminus' has a somewhat duex-ex-machine feel as it explains what is going to the characters
at points but overall I did enjoy this, and the ending (and actions of mankind on the earth) was surprisingly up beat, I'd 
expected more environmental doom and gloom but no, go Mankind!
