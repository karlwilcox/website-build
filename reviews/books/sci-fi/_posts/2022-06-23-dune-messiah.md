This re-read is being done in a single bargain priced 7-volume ebook but for the image I've been able
to find the cover of the New English Library paperback that I had as a teenager, which is nicely
nostalgic. This from the days when I was 13 or 14 and my sci-fi collection was less than two
feet of shelf space.

So I'm sure that you don't need me to go into the story, hopefully it will be covered a movie
soon enough but even today I am astounded by the depth and immersion of the Dune novels. The 
complexity of the social structures, political organisations and their motives ("plots
within plots") - it would be interesting to find out Frank Herbert worked (one imagines
lots of notebooks or a huge wall covered with cross-linked jottings like some police
procedural). There should be some scholarly attention to this like that of Tolkien, I
shall investigate what is out there...
