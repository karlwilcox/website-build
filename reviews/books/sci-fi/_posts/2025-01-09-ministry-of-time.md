Interesting concept - caught in a time war the men from the ministry grab some samples from the past and our
herione is assigned the care of an Arctic explorer. Beautifully written but sometimes a little slow - I almost
felt that I too was living through the long period confined to the safe house! But the characters were fully
realised and seem to act and react convincingly based on their own past and history and there were some great
lines, especially from the sassy madame! Genuinely ground breaking and an author to watch.
