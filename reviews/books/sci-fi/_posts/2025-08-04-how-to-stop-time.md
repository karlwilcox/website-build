I listened to this an audiobook, I think I must’ve picked it up in one of the
Audible two for one deals just to see what it was like, especially since I had
enjoyed “the midnight library”.

This is the story of Thomas who seems to be granted (without any particular
reason) and enormously extended lifetime and his adventures from Elizabethan in
England to the present day. All of these periods were cleverly intertwined and
the story moved along well in all those periods. I realise that Matt likes to
give a message in his novels (and obviously in his self-help books!) And in
this case I think it is to do with making the most of what you have, or what
you could have, right now and neither dwelling on the past or spending too much
time trying to protect your future at the expense present.

The lack of any kind of rationale or explanation allows the story to
concentrate on the main character and his reaction to things, which does make
for an interesting perspective.

So yes, I did enjoy this, the narration was fine, nicely paced and the story
was interesting enough to keep me listening, although the ending was just a
little low-key. Hopeful rather than dramatic or uplifting. A bit like real life
then!
