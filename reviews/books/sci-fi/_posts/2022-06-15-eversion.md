The "Emergency Medical Hologram" meets "Cloud Atlas" in a fun, stand-alone novel. Alastair obviously has a lot
of fun trying out different genres of story and styles of writing (showing the range of his writing talent)
but it turns out that this isn't just a showy affectation but is an integral part of the plot, in  particular
the way that the technology is improved on each iteration. This is a very cleverly constructed story that 
is well written and very enjoyable. Like all of Alastair's work I think it would be just as enjoyable on 
a re-read, although pretty tough to film! (Having said that, "Love, Death and Robots" did a fine job with 
"Beyond the Aquila Rift", albeit a short story not a full length novel). Great work Al!
