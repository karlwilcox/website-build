There's a certain structure to KSR novels-a fairly large cast of characters,
detailed technical descriptions, lots of conversations and a sequence of
incidents covered in depth; all within the framework of a larger story arc. But
not all of those incidents seem to move the story forward, not all of those
conversations are interesting, and sometimes that story doesn't get resolved,
it just seems to be a framework in which all the characters can chat and
interact. " Red Moon" was the archetypal example of this, and the" Mars" series
was a lot like this too." 2312" falls into this group too. Does that mean it is
good or bad?

A mix of both really, it isn't really a gripping page turner( except for a few
episodes near the end) and the main character, Swan, isn't actually very
sympathetic. And the story arc does advance to something like a resolution,
although the situation on Earth is resolved in a fairly unconvincing way. I did
leave this for a while but I'm glad I finished it-much (but by no means all)
was interesting and it is an optimistic view of the future. I'm sort of tempted
to follow it up with "New York 2140" which I think is set in the same timeline,
and one day I might do a" Mars" re-read, but the sheer volume of words and time
needed is too daunting right now!
