> Flash! Flash! I love you but we only have 14 hours to save the Earth!

Well, his name is Kayl and it is 40 years, but you get the idea...

This drops you right into the action and pretty much doesn't let up. There's
almost no back story, which comes out as we go along, although there is rather
a lot of existential talk between the two main characters which can drag a little,
although being fortunate never to have experience extreme predjudice I can still
understand that it may well have a huge impact on your outlook on life and your
future relationships.

My biggest gripe is that this has either a **very** unsatisfactory ending or is
the first in a series but not advertises as such! Presumably the sub-title "The
Doomed Earth" is going to be the name of the series?

Anyway, I'm not revealing anything beyond the first few pages to relate that the
Earth is destroyed in 2180 but such is the violence of the event that our
heroine, and part of her spaceship is catapulted back to 2140 to meet our hero, and
between them they attempt to change history and save the Earth. There's a lot of
running about, scenes on multiple planets and some quite exciting set-pieces. So yes,
grudingly, I will get the next one when it comes out (and knowing Jack, the following
six as well - after all he does have 40 years to fill out...)
