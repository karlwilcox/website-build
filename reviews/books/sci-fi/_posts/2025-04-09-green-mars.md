To be honest no a lot actually happens - there's a *lot* talking,
some existential angst over longevity and many descriptions of the
martian landscape, flora and geology but theres very little actual
action until the final chapter. Yet despite all that I've been looking
forward to getting back to Mars and immersing myself in it. Not as good
(or as exciting) as Red Mars but strangely compelling nonetheless.

Onwards to Blue!
