A very complex story split between post-plague Chasm City and the war-ravaged
planet of Sky’s Edge in which we learn a fair bit of the history of both. It
starts out as an apparently straight-forward assassination chase but becomes
increasingly complex, both due to the plague situation on Yellowstone and some
interior issues with out would-be assassin. Are these just a by-product of the
hibernation sleep or is it something more sinister?

In fact it turns out to be several layers of sinister with multiple nested
personalities. This actually gets so complicated that I started to loose track
of character motivations, in particular for the main protagonist. I didn’t
totally buy the initial assassination premise, it seemed a bit extreme to take
a 30 year hibernation sleep and as more layers of personality were peeled back
I didn’t really understand *their* motivations either. There were also quite a
few convenient coincidences and meetings, and it seemed somewhat incredible
that our hero encounters a previously unknown species both far in his own past
en-route to Sky’s Edge and the bottom of the chasm.

Overall though this has all the classic Reynolds touches, a huge imagination,
exciting incidents and massive depth of universe building (not that I would
particularly like to live there!). This was a re-read, I recall owning the
paperback more than 20 years ago and I know that I read it but I’m not sure how
much I really understood the first time around, I just have a memory of a few
scenes but the final reveal was apparently all new to me.

A worthwhile read, just for the imagination displayed and the clever structure
and story-telling but I can never quite past how bleak the revelation space
universe is!
