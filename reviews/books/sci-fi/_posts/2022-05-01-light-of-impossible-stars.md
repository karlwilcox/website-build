Listened to this as an audiobook and really enjoyed it, excellent narration by a team of narrators apparently.

This is the story of the "Trouble Dog", the fleet of knives and an alien city and moves along at a good pace. I really
liked all the characters, especially Nod the engineer and was really rooting for everyone. A great piece of space
opera with real heart and a great conclusion to the series. Good work Gareth!
