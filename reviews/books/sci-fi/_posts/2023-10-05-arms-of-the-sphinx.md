You could actually call this volume “Senlin Ascends Further “ as this is indeed
what I hero does, both geographically and climbing further at the tower and
also socially by inadvertently becoming captain of a pirate airship and leader
of a band of brigands. The story continues with Senlin still pursuing his
intended - very commedable, although from what we have seen of her she seems to
be managing fairly well. The Sphinx of the title is an oracle that may be able
to help in the quest but things don’t quite go to plan and a major fracas
ensues.

There is plenty more inventive world building and lots of action, but also
underpinned by some serious thought given to how such a large tower would
impact it surrounding environment and weather patterns. So more of the same
good quality fantasy steampunk fare.

I have not (at time of writing this, in August 2025) moved to the final volume,
I needed a bit of break from the rather intense narrative but fully intend to
complete my reading at a later date and see if our lovers are finally reunited.
