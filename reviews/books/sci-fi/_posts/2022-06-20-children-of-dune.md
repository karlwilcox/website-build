This was as far as I got when reading the sequence as a teenager - I had the first three volumes in paperback
with the nice pictorial covers. This time around I'm reading them as a 7 volume ebook and enjoying them 
even more, I'm not sure I really understand everything when I was but a callow youth. Anyway, this time
around, and after 1,500 pages I'm still finding it incredibly deep, detailed and engrossing. A triumph of 
immersive world-building that has neither dated nor become stale. I could read this again with equal
pleasure.
