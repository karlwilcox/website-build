An absolute tour-de-force of world building and character driven, political plots but still exciting and moving. It 
moves the characters from" A Memory called Empire" on in convincing ways and we get to learn more of the empire's 
home planet and the pilots space station, enough convincing world building in either for most authors! 
Then we learn of one of live aboard an empire space fleet and 
do some sterling work making first contact with an alien race. Totally immersive, this is a more than worthy sequel 
and cements Arkady as a great SF author
