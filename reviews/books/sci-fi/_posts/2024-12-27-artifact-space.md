This was a re-read before listening to book 2 - and boy was it just as good the
second time around. It has beena  while since a book gripped me sufficiently
that I wanted to spend every spare minute reading it and hence dash through the
whole thing in a few days but this had me hooked all over again.

A fantastic piece of space opera with all the trimmings, giant star-faring ships,
space habitats, trade, weaponry and military action. We follow the story of
Marca Nbaro from the orphanage to the Greatship Athens and her adventures
with new friends on the trade routes and encounters with aliens. There's
nothing new here, no trope or situation that you haven't already come
across before but the way that they are used and the pacing, style
and use of language really drive this along. We get right inside Marca
and her feelings and motivations and share her successes and her pains.

Terrific work and I'm really looking forward to the conclusion in "Deep Black".
