Our author makes competent use of some familiar SF tropes (the “big dumb
object”, impoverished NASA, aggressive private spaceflight rival) and some very
familiar character types (nerdy geek with his discovery, washed up astronaut,
crazed military man).

We have an interstellar object decelerating into the solar system and some
competing missions to investigate it and unravel the mystery. It is all a bit
familiar to start with and a couple of early questionable statements jar
slightly (the author seems to be confused whether his character is in Houston
or at JPL in Pasadena and at one point the competing spacecraft is 40km away
stationary relative to our own craft and then a few sentences later it is
10km).

But once things get going it moves along at a reasonable pace, possibly a bit
slow in places (the long slog through the object was a slog for the reader too)
but the author makes good use of this familiar material to tell an interesting
story with a nice neat ending.

Not ground-breaking science fiction, and I’m unlikely to want to re-read it but
it was entertaining enough for a while.
