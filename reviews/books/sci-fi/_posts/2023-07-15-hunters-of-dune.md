I spent many months engrossed in the world of Dune and the two original
trilogies, even after plowing through 1000 pages I need to get back into that
immersive story.

Kevin and Brian continue that theme and do a faithful job of taking forwards
the characters, situations and general feel of the original books, but
ultimately I do think there is something missing, Brian is not his father but
perhaps it wasn’t intending I was going to bring something more to the
narrative. Actual resurrections of the original characters was an interesting
move, I’m not sure whether it’s lazy or genius, but I’m less inclined to carry
on with the sequel to this particular one. However, I still find fascination in
this world and perhaps one day will return and I do see the various prequels
calling out to me and I’m trying to collect the set as they appear on the
Kindle deals of the day!
