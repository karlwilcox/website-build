Another step in the revelation space re-read...

More high concept hard science-fiction that demand is just as much from the
reader as the previous volume. It takes the story forward now that the
inhibitors are in the Delta Pavonis system and all of our original characters
are still there, sometimes in very different guises.

As usual with Alistair the story is well told, scientifically very literate and
ultimately rather bleak! Yes, we do have a redemption Arc/Ark in both senses of
the word, for the for Triumvir Volyova and for the ship-captain amalgam; but
Volyova’s gesture turns out to be glorious but ultimately pointless (as was the
whole battle for the hell class weapons) and the end point of the ships journey
it’s not quite the sanctuary that everyone was promised. Scorpio the pig is
still my favourite character.

Technically and narratively a great accomplishment, but really, not a
comforting read.
