Sorry, but I didn't like this and only grudgingly read all the way to the end.
It starts off well enough, an alt history version of Moon exploration, rather
like "for all mankind" and there is a nice air of mystery that is set up when
strange things are happening both to our heroes, the Americans and to their
Russian rivals and circumstances soon force a reluctant partnership.

Unfortunately, it turns out that everything that's happening is inside
someone's own head and therefore there are no longer any rules, anything can
happen, nothing has to be explained and ultimately nothing really matters. It's
all a shame because it's well written and starts with an exciting premise but
rapidly turns from hard science-fiction to a psychological exploration.

I donated the paperback to a local villag Book swap and noticed it was still
there several months later! Perhaps it was the wrong intended audienceâ€¦
