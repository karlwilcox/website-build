If you asked me to make a list of the significant events that happened in “blue
Mars“ then the chances are it would be very short!

I have to be honest and say that not only is there very little incident in this
book. There is very little excitement although there is some interest, but only
if you have read and enjoyed the previous books, and in particular the
characters. This is something of a self-indulgent book in a way, Our author,
having already spent 1500 pages with his creations is deeply invested in them
and their thoughts and in our lives. He has spent another 750 pages sharing
those in our lives with us.

I can’t really summarise the story, as there isn’t one we just leap from person
to person finding a great deal or more about each one and their lives on the
new Mars. A cliffhanger, if there is one, is a takeover of the space elevator
and some illegal settlement by the Earth nations, but the whole thing is
resolved by everyone being nice to each other.

I don’t want to sound too negative about this, I did read a little of this book
every day and look forward to it and returning to our second blue planet but it
really is the weakest of the three and didn’t really add a lot to the story
Arc.

I did come across the book of short stories and additional background
information “the Martians“ as a Kindle deal so I’ve added that to my library
and maybe one day we’ll see whether that gives me the same warm feelings.
