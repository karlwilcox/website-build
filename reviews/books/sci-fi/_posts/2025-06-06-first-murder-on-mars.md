This story is sat on a near future Mars where there has been societal collapse
and an abandonment by an earth and mesh in its own walls. It is a search for
the truth of the events that triggered the collapse,, told of a various
timelines. This is not a fun place to live on the whole…

This was a good read,, it didn’t break in new ground, everything was made from
familiar tropes but that’ll allow the story to move along without the need for
a lot of exposition. There’s quite a bit of violence and a high body count of
named characters (no one gets out alive!) But the story is well told. My only
gripe is the apparently missing backstory of the “Outliers” and quite how the
outliers became simultaneously so violently bloodthirsty but also well
organised and making the most of their environment – in many respects seeming
to do better than the “company“, full aerospace are doing on their own bit of
Mars.

Just a minor quibble however, overall this was a good engaging story that I
read in a few days and looked forward to getting back into.
