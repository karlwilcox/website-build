It was either this or "Use of Weapons" that were my first introduction to the Culture universe, I
think I picked the paperback sometime after its release in the late 1980's or early 1990, and to be
I didn't know what to make of it at first. There is no easy introduction to the culture, every
novel in the series drops you right in the middle, as if the author had everything already in
his head and just took things for granted. Indeed, based on the big notebook published
posthomously this is pretty much the case.

Anyway, this is the interleaved story of the changer and the endangered Culture "Mind"
fleeing from a lost battle and hiding out on a planet quarantined by god-like powers as
a memorial to its dead civilization. There some great locations, the doomed orbital,
the temple visited by the rather hopeless bunch of mercenaries, and the command system
on the dead planet. There are some great battle scenes and we learn much about the
conduct and the participants in the Idiran war.

This is not the Culture at its best, this is the culture falling back under heavy
assault from an implacable enemy (there are even supplementary chapters, essentially
very long footnotes that explain the back ground to the war and include statistics
for armamentophiles as Iain calls them in a later book.

There are some great characters but as war often seems to mean there are no true
heroes here - most of the main characters do questionable, if understandable things.

Read this one for the battle scenes and for completeness, not as an uplifting comfort read!
