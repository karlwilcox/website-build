Being a list of brief notes on other culture consumed over the last few months that I either abandoned or don't feel needs a longer discussion.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Lightyear** Disney+. This was too long and really dragged in the middle but
did get better eventually. The best joke had been spoilered in the trailer and Sox was the stand-out star!

{% include icon shape="book" %} **Broadland - David Blake** Norfolk Broads set police procedural. A workman-like story
with nothing to really stand out with in this rather crowded genre, and the "romance" between the lead characters
was just cringey.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **The Dropout** The astonishing tale of the blood testing company Theranos with a
great performance by Jennifer Lawrence. Convincingly acted and totally gripping - surprisingly tense at times.

{% include icon shape="book" %} **Bad Blood - John Carreyrou** Inspired
