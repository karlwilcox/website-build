Being a list of brief notes on other culture consumed over the last few months that I either abandoned or don't feel needs a longer discussion.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Welcome to Chippendale** all new to me, fascinating story, well told; couldn't help
noticing similarity between the main character here and his counterpart in "The Dropout".

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Shotgun Wedding** daft but fun harmless popcorn movie lifted above the ordinary by
Jennifer Coolidge and Lennie Kravitz(!)

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Lady Chatterly's Lover (2022)** nicely done, believable and well acted. enjoyed this.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Bank of Dave** Corny, simplistic, emotionally manipulative, and takes huge liberties with the true story, but I absolutely loved this!

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Father Stu** interesting story, well acted but accent was almost unintelligible (and
nothing like the real priest, according to the clips at the end!)

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Your Place or Mine** unlikely premise but fun movie, albeit about rich privileged
people. Everything everywhere was so clean!
