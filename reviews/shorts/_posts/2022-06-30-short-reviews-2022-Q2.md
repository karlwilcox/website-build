Being a list of brief notes on other culture consumed over the last few months that I either abandoned or don't feel needs a longer discussion.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **The Eyes of Tammy Faye**  Bio-pic about the wife of a US television evangelist. A well acted movie and a really intriguing story but not something I could watch again

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Spencer** A slice of the life of Diana, Princess of Wales. A tour-de-force of the film makers art
(the techniques could fill a fair few media studies lectures) but not really a particularly interesting story and overall not a great piece of
actual entertainment.

{% include icon shape="movie" %} **Death on the Nile (2022)** Beautifully filmed, intricately plotted and quite fun - indeed so complicated that
I would probably enjoy watching this a second time just as much!

{% include icon shape="tvshow" %} **Pieces of Her** A Netflix show staring Toni Collette (who seems to be everywhere these days!) She witnesses
a violent crime that kicks her mother into equally violent action and opens a family can of worms. This was quite a complex story, but enjoyable,
really only being let down by the totally unconvincing setting - supposedly Georgia in the US but obviously Australia! Why not just change
the setting!

{% include icon shape="book" %} **A Short History of Europe** Simon Jenkins. Listened to as an audiobook - well written engaging history but ultimately I
just felt rather sad.
