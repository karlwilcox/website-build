This show is a triumph. It is brilliantly cast, looks astounding and is reliably faithful
to its source material. I really enjoyed every aspect of this (although the David Thewlis episode
was kinda bleak) and carefully rationed out the episodes to get maximum enjoyment.

In particular I want to call out the first 20 minutes of "The Sound of Her Wings" - this
is possibly some of the best television you will ever see. A masterclass in writing,
story telling and acting. There are no special effects, no big dramatic scenes but
for heart, compassion and the importance of living well it is unsurpassed. I could
watch this again and again.
