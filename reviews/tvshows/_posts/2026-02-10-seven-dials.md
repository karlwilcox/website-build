This was several hours of great fun, an undemanding watch with actors who
were clearly enjoying themselves, wearing nice costumes and occupying very
pleasant scenery.

The plot, for what it is worth, involves 
the delightful Mia McKenna-Bruce, Lady Eileen (known as "Bundle"
since all posh children seem to require unrelated nicknames), daughter
of a rather financially distressed widow effortlessly played by
Helena Bonham-Carter. There is a wonderful supporting cast of
charming upper class twits, largely working for the foreign
office; suitably unobtrusive serving staff; and a put-upon
superintendent testily played by Martin Freeman (and cleverly,
not really introduced until the second of the three episodes).
There's an African inventor who supplies the McGuffin around
which the plot revolves and lots of mysterious goings-on at
society parties.

It's all *very* British, very Agatha Christie and just a pleasure
to watch if you want to pass a few hours without straining your
faculties overmuch.
