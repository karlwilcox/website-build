A washed up journalist visits a small town to do a puff piece on the recovery of a small
outback town from a terrible mass shooting a year before. He discovers more than he bargains
for and begins to peice together what really happened, rediscovery his journalistic mojo
and picking up a new girlfriend along the way.

I enjoyed this pretty faithful adaptation of the novel. I didn't think it was hugely demanding
on the viewer, largely due to nicely colour graded flashback scenes which revelead a lot of the
backstory - although much of this was known only to those present in the scene (who subsequently
died) so could not be known to Martin Scarsden and the other protagonists. Probably a good 
decision as it was a fairly complex story but it did move along and held my attention.
