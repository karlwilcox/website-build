Blimey, this was hard going sometimes. It took 10, albeit atmospheric episodes before it
actually got exciting. It seemed to me that every scene up to that point lingered just
a bit too long, and the episode involving the walk in the woods was just tedious.

I can forgive a lot however for the sight of the Choreography and Merriment marching
band, although one can't help wondering whether they also have "day jobs" when they
aren't needed for celebrations!

In fairness, yes, every shot reeked atmosphere and the depth of the Lumon
Industries theming could give Walt Disney a run for his money, there was
probably a lot that I missed had I searched every frame but I'm just not sure
that the payoff would be worth the effort.

Some nice touches, and clever scenes but honestly, not really enough actual
narrative to fill all the episodes. More story or a shorter season might have
been better...
