An interesting approach to tell both the story itself and the story of how
it came to be written. It saved something that could have been rather
relentlessly bleak by interspersing it with Australian sunshine; and it
did show how the repercussions of the events still resonated over
the following years. The flashbacks were sometimes out of order,
which made things hard to follow at times, although this was perhaps
an editorial decision to intentionally disorient the viewer? It was
certainly gruesome in parts but not sensationist. Some things seem
to be skipped over for narrative reasons but the was some good
acting, especially by Harvey Keitel.
