As always a keenly observed and bitingly funny story of our (mostly) middle class Londoners. The actual children, as
usual are hardly to be seen and completely peripheral to the actual stories. Arguably, the stories in this season
are getting a little darker but none the worse for this. You just know that they writers have been through
all this and worse!
