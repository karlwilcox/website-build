This perhaps took an episode or two to get back into its stride but soon enough
becomes a much loved part of our lives.

There’s some actual conflict here, or at least we have an antagonist with a
little more (but not too much) at stake, and Becky and Andy are having issues,
almost all laid at the door of the hopelessly indecisive Andy. Lance has his
own dramas, apparently with a younger woman and there are some surprisingly
sweet moments between Terry and Sheila.

The dialogue is, as always, both convincingly real and amusing, and there are
some great visual humour moments — the lemonade incident and the mayor opening
his front door spring to mind.

Fortunately all the conflicts are resolved by the end of episode six — Becky
perhaps being a little bit too forward on Andy’s behalf but then he does need
it.

Episode seven was an unexpected bonus, presumably a Christmas special, set in
December and with Becky and Stanley left behind in Botswana (land of Bridge and
Death Metal).

Another great series that shows that you don’t need explosions or earth
shattering events to make good drama and that a quiet contemplative style can
be funnier than slapstick.

Always worth watching and I would probably enjoy it all over again if I watched
it in a year’s time.
