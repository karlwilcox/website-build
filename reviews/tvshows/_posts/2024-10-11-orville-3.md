Almost-live-reviewing here, let's see what we think of each episode as we do the
daily(ish) binge watch...

**Episode 1** - In the aftermath of the battle there is resentment aboard the Orville
about the reinstatement of Isaac to active duty. The initial dream / battle sequence
was a bit long and tedious (don't spend all the budget on special effects for
episode 1 guys). The story was OK, and it was a good way to introduce Charly as
the new navigator, although again the testing of the new little runabout was
too long and ultimately a bit pointless, it didn't advance the plot at all. In
general I don't think they are making good use of the extra running time so far.

**Episode 2** - an opportunty to explore uncharted space
leads to an unfortunate alien infection - despite the warnings of the
Krill. Mildly interesting little bit of back story between Dr. Finn and
Paul the admiral but again this episode was just too long (I did skip some
of the corridor chase scenes). Other than the personal relationships this
episode was *very* derivative, which is ironic for a show that derives
almost everything from Star Trek, but in this case they also brought in
all "The Thing" style horror tropes, which I personally dislike so much.
And no-one seemed to give a toss about the loss of all the expendable
crew members turned in aliens and then variously shot, virus-ed and
broken into pieces by the security chief. All seems to be going a bit
heartless and they forgot the fun and banter that made previous seasons
so good.

**Episode 3** - well, that was much better! The crew investigate a once
barren planet now apparently teeming with an advanced civilisation. A
genuinely intriging puzzle piece, nicely acted by the various away teams and
some clever mis-direction in the plot twists. There were even some
funny bits with Gordon almost regaining his season 2 mojo. The big
reveal at the end was a nice call back to a previous episode and
the motivation for all the illusions was interesting, plus there
are hints of further contact with the Q continuum! Sorry, I mean
inhabitants of the multi-phasic planet...

**Episode 4** - this served to move the story arc along on the grand
galactic stage rather than focussing on our favourite crew. The sets
and the CGI planet of the Krill were very impressive, as were those of
future New York, and I did like the multi-racial cast of 'Annie'. I'm
not a big fan of space battles they are cheap in narrative terms (even
if expensive in CGI terms). In this case the battle didn't achieve anything
on either side and as usual, no-one seen to care about lives or ships
lost. Would have better writing perhaps to have the fleets stand-off
facing each other and to extract the landing party by some stealthy means
rather than the Star Wars derivative speeder chase - also rather lazy.
Too much noise and explosions not enough smart writing.
