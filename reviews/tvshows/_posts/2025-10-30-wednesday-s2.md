Very much a season of two halves - the first was over-gory, seemed a little
padded (the camping scene trying but failing to recapture the spirit of the Poe
cup) and most importantly they just forgot to make it fun!

However, starting from the sublime body swap episode right through to the
climax the second half more than redeemed itself. The body swapping was
cleverly written and brilliantly acted and deserved a second watch to keep
everything straight in your head.

The rest of the family did finally have something to do and we get interesting
back stories for Gomez (who had previously seemed a little one dimensional) and
even for Thing (a welcome and unexpected development). There was another great
dance routine, the final mistake by Agnes and her rueful smile was the perfect
finish to a great sequence. We even saw Wednesday smile briefly.

It was good to see uncle Fester back for the final scene and things are set up
very nicely for season three. Let’s hope that gets off to a better start and
maintains the highs from this season.
