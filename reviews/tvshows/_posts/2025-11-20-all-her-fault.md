The story of a very young boy from a wealthy Chicago familywho was kidnapped on
a play date that quite rapidly spirals into a whole mess of family secrets and
past accidents. The more we learn about this family the more odd the situation
becomes and tension and drama wraps up as the hunt for Milo intensifies.
There's also a nice counterpoint sub plot with the detective and his own
disabled son and we explore just what parents are prepared to do for their
children.

The title is especially clever as almost every female character here is made to
feel that something is their fault even if it's finally revealed that almost
none of it was and all of them were being manipulated in one way or another.

Nice acting all around, and interesting to see various size of Chicago life,
although it must be said that being affluent does not necessarily mean you live
in a nice house, that concrete bunker was both ugly and unwelcoming!

I did like the way the plot moved along quite quickly, as soon as Marissa (the
mother) discovered a secret she would immediately confront the secret holder
and we would have it either resolved or see it open up a new can of worms.

An excellent show that was both entertaining and raised a lot of interesting
discussion points.
