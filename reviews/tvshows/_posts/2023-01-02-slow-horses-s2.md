This is very faithful to the books, and all the better for it. This is the
small village / light aircraft / Russian meeting / jewel heist one (yes, really). 
Brilliantly acted 
throughout (although does any family actually need **that** much tonic water?).
A complex story, well told. I've watched the whole series twice now and enjoyed
it thoroughly both times.
