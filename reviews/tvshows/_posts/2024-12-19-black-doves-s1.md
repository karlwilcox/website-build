Someone at Netflix clearly got very jealous about the success of "Slow Horses" and
wanted to make their own fast paced, morally ambiguous, darkly humourous show about
spies and stuff. Oh, yeah, and the way to make it *better* than Slow Horses is to
have a _really_ high body count, right?

Well, wrong. But everything else was spot on the just-as-good-as rung of the ladder.
Quite a complex tale that did eventually all come together in the last show, with
some great actors clearly having a lot of fun with their quick-fire and witty lines.
(Amongst my favourites, Williams after hearing how herion really screws up  your life
laconically comments "so, overall, about 7/10 then".)

Not quite as grounded in reality as its competitor so a bit less believable but cleverly
written and well setup for a second series needing only Mrs Reed to establish the
continuity (and you could get away without her by just bringing in someone else in the
same position). My guess is that the second series will be commissioned and will
find me as a willing and eager viewer.
