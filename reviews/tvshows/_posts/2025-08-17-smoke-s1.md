It starts out as a straightforward arson investigation story but after two
episodes takes a very strange and unexpected turn.

There are no heroes here, everyone is flawed and some are dirty, it is just
that some are more flawed and dirtier than others. This show is a slow burn
(see what I did there?) that makes the most of the long run time a TV series
permits, sometimes taking too much time between story beats which it can at times.

Cleverly written, brilliantly acted (hey, Rafe Spall can do an American
accent!) and definitely NOT the police procedural I was expecting, you have not
seen a show like this before so you might as well give it a go…
