(This is the re-watch, as promised in an earlier, now removed review!)

The show continues with its rich depth, fabulous visuals and some really nice
touches – I really like the way Gaal left footprints in the sand but Hari’s
projection at her side left none, a subtle but clever effect.

There are multiple interwoven stories, ironically at least for the first few
episodes are those of Hari and are the least interesting, I find myself wanting
to get back to Trantor and the machinations of the three Empire.

It is good to see real high-concept Science Fiction on TV, something that takes
its time to tell the story and isn’t afraid to talk a fair bit of science
(rather than Star Trek-esque techno-babble), and can be moving, profound and
still funny in places. That’s not to say it is perfect, I am still not
completely sure what Hari was doing with the Mentalics (were they the second
foundation? And it so, how did that woman end up in charge?) and the fight
scene with Salvor outside the Beggar just went on far too long for very little
pay-off. I’m looking forward to the third season and would be quite happy for
this show to run for the full 10 that I understand the show runners have
already outlined!
