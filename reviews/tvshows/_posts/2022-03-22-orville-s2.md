A solid follow-on from season one, there were some real fun episodes here and the
characters do have some (fairly shallow) development arcs. I did not enjoy the
two parter - I don't watch this show for endless CGI space battles, we have
seen them all before and that isn't the USP or the main attraction of this show. Don't try to
out-Star-Trek Star Trek! The final episode was much better and much closer to the
heart of what makes this show good.
