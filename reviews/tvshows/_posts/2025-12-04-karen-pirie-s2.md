Following some heavy rain a body is revealed in a quarry that seems to be
related to the kidnapping and subsequent disappearance of an heiress and her
child in 1984. Karen, fresh from her success and promotion in season one is
given all the resources she needs to reopen the case. There are lots of twists
and turns leading us (and the team) from Scotland to Malta, via France and
Italy.

This was well acted again, with some minor but real development of the
characters and the 1980’s scenes are both well realised and fit in well to
reveal what we need to know as the detectives discover it.

I have to say that I didn’t see the final reveal coming, on top of all the
twists and turns that we had already been through but it wasn’t forced or
implausible ( a credit to the original author).

So on my second attempt I did really enjoy this, certainly helped by having
watched the first season. And if there are future seasons (there are several
more books available) then I will be first in the queue!
