More Norfolk based crime drama, this is the one with links back to the
second world war so a plausible reason why a bones expert might be
needed, although it leads to more peril than you might expect! I
did wonder how having a child would cramp Ruth's investigative efforts
and now we know - there's a **very** accommodating child minder on the
outskirst of King's Lynn (a town that seems to be flexible in location
given the time it takes to drive there from various places...) The story
itself was okay, I didn't totally buy the motivation for the crime and
there were one or two convenient plot points (e.g. the phone call to
Tatjana) but I did enjoy it and will carry on with the series. (I have
the first six here in an omnibus edition eBook).
