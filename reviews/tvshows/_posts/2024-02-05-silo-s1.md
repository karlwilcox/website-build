A bit frustrating this one, interestingly the same reaction I had to the book, which I didn't finish
(so doesn't have a review here).

The production looks great, yet another retro-futuristic grungily impressive set and it is well
acted with the high quality production values we expect from Apple. My misgivings relate to the
story and how far we have progressed from the initial premise "there's this big underground
chamber where everyone lives". I've watched the whole season and apart from some hints that
there is a bigger mystery being hidden here nothing is actually resolved and the final episode
was just one long pointless and rather dull chase scene that didn't advance the plot at all.

We had better start getting some answers in season 2!
