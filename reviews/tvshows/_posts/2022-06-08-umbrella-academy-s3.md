This became increasingly dark but also very sweet and intimate in places. The finale
was overlong, to the point of tedium almost but overall this was another great
act of television. We've come to really like the characters, they are all distinct
personalities and as we have come to expect with these big budget shows the 
production values, special and visual effects are all pretty faultless. There
is also a very effective use of music and songs. Good work that would support
a re-watch one day.
