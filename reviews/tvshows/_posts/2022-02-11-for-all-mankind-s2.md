Inevitably this moves further away from real events, which is not necessarily a bad thing as the show
needs to make its own path from now. It also moves forwards from the 60s and 70s into a more divergent
timeline but still with clever call backs to genuine events, movements and attitudes of those time. I
also note that those characters who are most clearly based on actual people get written out in
various ways, ranging from off-screen and mentioned in passing to the incredibly dramatic season finale
climax! The setup for the climax was a little bit contrived but the emotional impact was still very
high.

There was lots of humour, convincing gadgets, realistic politics, great production values
and interesting story lines but
I did miss those heady 1960s days ripe with future possibilities. But still a "must-see" for
anyone interested in the medium of TV science fiction.
