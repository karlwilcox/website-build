I enjoyed this a *lot* more than I thought I would! I was expecting something a bit silly, or at least
juvenile but this was great. A show with real heart that loves its source material but doesn't take
it too seriously. The call outs to ST are clever in that they are convincing (how minor players in the 
ST Universe could well react to the "big stars") and the whole thing remains plausibly "in canon".
The animation is just as detailed as it needs to be (the full CGI works would distract from
the characters and story) and the characters are great, beautifully drawn (in a narrative sense)
and well acted. Thank heavens for subtitles though, without them I'd never keep up - they talk
**so** fast...!
