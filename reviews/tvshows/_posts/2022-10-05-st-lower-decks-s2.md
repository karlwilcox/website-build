I'm really liking this show, binge watching this season over a most of the last week. What I particularly
like is that it has real heart which pokes gentle but reverent fun at its source material while
telling its own stories. We like all the characters, they have distinct (and distinctive) personalities
and their situation is plausible, both within the hierarchy of the ship, and the role of the ship
itself within the fleet (*someone* has to set up those sub-space relays after all!). Some of the 
best Star Trek, this can hold its own against the live action series any day.
