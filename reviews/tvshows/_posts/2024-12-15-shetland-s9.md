A quite enjoyable story but the clues were carefully doled out to provide constant redirection
(not knowing the total number of episodes I was expecting the denoument at the end of at least
three of them!). It starts with the discovery of two seemingly unrelated bodies and expands to
take in conspiracy theorists, illegal genetic labs, mysterious pasts in the secret service
and several awkward family relationships. And this is my concern here with my otherwise
complete enjoyment of this season is that the misdirection / doling out of clues was *solely*
for the purpose of dragging out the story to fill the available episodes. There was plenty of
interesting stuff here but needlessly over-complicated and I think this might have been
more enjoyable as two three-part stories. Have the courage to break the six episode mould folks!

A couple of points come to mind as a result of watching this season - so little actually happens
on the islands that characters _have_ to go elsewhere to end with a sufficiently interesting
back story that returns to haunt them later; *and* those characters are always drawn back to
the islands eventually!
