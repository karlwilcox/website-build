Another Australian crime drama, this one involving cold cases and a lead
detective with major personal issues (are there no normal, well adjusted
detectives anywhere?) The backpack of a girl that went missing 20 years ago is
found in the small town that she lived in and our hero manages to piece
together the events surrounding it. Some things are told in flashback so aren’t
really known to the main characters, but overall it does work quite well.

My main issue is that everyone in this town has secrets and they are revealed
in such an order as to cause maximum misdirection before the actual perpetrator
is revealed. I shouldn’t really complain, however, as it has certainly kept me
hooked.
