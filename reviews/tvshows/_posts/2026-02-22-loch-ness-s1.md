A complex multi-murder mystery set around the titular body of water and largely
taking place in the fictional town of Luchnary. This has improved my knowledge
of Scottish geography as I investigated the area on Google maps and identified
Fort Augustus as the filming location (at least for the establishing shots),
and I hadn’t realised how close Inverness was to the Loch, nor that there is
little in the way of roads on the Eastern shore.

There is a fairly good attempt at making the location an integral part of the
story – the local DCI recognises that a serial killer in Loch Ness will draw
the world’s attention, and many of the characters are involved in the tourist
trade (there doesn’t seem to be much other commercial activity!).

There’s a huge amount of incident packed into the six episodes, largely because
almost everyone in the town seems to have some major secrets that are harshly
revealed (thankfully our heroine’s family secret turns out to be quite minor on
this scale). Whether the sheer density of weird goings-on in this small
Scottish town is at all credible is an open question.

I like the way the action moves along, the only over-long “tease” is the body
in the loch that, annoyingly, is almost found on several occasions such that by
the final episode we are yelling at the team to look in the lake for goodness
sake!

This isn’t great TV – there’s far too much coincidence (no-one here has a dull
and unexciting life) and just too many secrets packed into a small space, and
the police psychological profiler is not very likeable (yet has history,
inevitably, with the SIO) but it is watchable and interesting. There was no
second series and I for one don’t need one – so much happened here to have it
all over again would stretch credibility too far.
