I have watched this twice in the last month and probably enjoyed it even more the second time around.
The final episode is some absolutely cracking television and played to perfection by everyone
involved. David Mitchell is great, although one gets the feeling it isn't actually much of
a stretch for him as he's really just being David Mitchell.

Every episode is clever, both in the "murder-du-jour" and in moving forward the story arc. The
only episode that did flag a little was the building site murder, which all seemed a bit
contrived but it still retains that cleverness.

There had better be a second season of this or I'll be burning my TV licence outside parliament.
