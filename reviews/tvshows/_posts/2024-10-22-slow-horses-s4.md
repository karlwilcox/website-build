Started off a little slowly - River is in some ways the least interesting character
as he has no major hangups and the scenes with his grandad and the later solo
trip to France weren't especially exciting. We want to see the whole gang
working together (or not!)

So the later episodes were much better, and indeed the final two episodes were
very exciting, the tension never really let up! And the final denouement of
Patrice was a masterpiece of dark humour acting!

As always high quality production values, lots of scenes of gritty London but
also nice to see the redeveloped railway lands north of Kings Cross.
