A lot to live up to and it wasn't totally clear where the show would go after the end
of the first season but season two really does deliver on the story front. We still have
the fast talking witty dialogue and the surprisingly disfunctional characters that we
have come to love but the newly introduced plot elements work mostly well.

Paul's increasing fraility is handled sensitively to start with, especially with his
daughter although it fizzles out a bit at the end. And the introduction of the drunk
driver, and his back story was a masterstroke, although I wasn't totally bought in
to the casting, (why didn't he just go back to the UK?) although it was well acted.

Overall though another great season and the "Liz's purpose! Liz's purpose?" has become
a regular meme in our household.
