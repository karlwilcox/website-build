Continuing the binge watch, but restricting myself to one or two episodes per evening as
it is such a pleasure! Well, apart from the really annoying episode with Peanut Hamper,
but otherwise this season was absolutely top notch and the final was genuinely exciting
and very clever in pulling together all the plot threads and character arcs that had
been revealed in previous shows.
