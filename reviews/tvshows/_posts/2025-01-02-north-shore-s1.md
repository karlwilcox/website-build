"Fish out of water" / "cop out of jurisdiction" crime drama. Clever use of the
idea of an observor without authority aiding an investigation, and very good
personal relationships and drama that doesn't seem forced or detracts
from the crime story - and the shock ending was personal not professional
and better for it.

It was a bit of shame that there wasn't much of a sense of place, I didn't
come away with much of an understanding or appreciation of the North Shore
of Sydney - you could easily imagine this drama re-set in London with an
Australian observor and call it "Mayfair". True, there were some nice
touches and cultural misunderstandings but not a huge sense of
"Australian-ness" - perhaps something for the second series which
I would certainly support.

In short, a great combination of personal drama, crime investigation
and humour. Well done to all concerned.
