Another awkwardly titled TV series because viewer are dumb and need continuity between
series. Inappropriate since there wasn't much scrubland to be found in the fairly lush
coastal resort of Port Silver (although the Hummingbird retreat really doesn't look
that inviting...)

We find Martin Scarsden receiving a strange phone call and becoming mixed up in a
current property and tax evasion scheme tied up with a mysterious disappearance
and his own past.

So this is another faithful adaptation of the novel, pretty well done, with even
some moments of humanity for Doug the low-life TV host. There is a lot of back
story for Martin as he returns to the town he grew up in and left under
something of a cloud. He really should have told Mandy a lot of this, it isn't
like Mandy is a stranger to questionable decisions herself...

Sadly, I do have a few gripes. I've got to say that the Hummingbird Retreat
really does not look that inviting (a few yoga mats and a table on a tatty
stretch of beach) but more importantly the proposed development
on that same site is hugely out of scale with what was there - the
architectural model we get to see is just stupidly unrealistic with its
vast harbour and dozens of sky-scrapers. It would be way beyond the reach
of all but the largest developers and not something remotely feasible
for a local estate estate agent and a business owner.

Most other things were going well until the big climax. We go from daylight
to full darkness in a single shot (this also happened at the end of season
one as well - is there something wrong with Antipodean sunsets?)

And the rest of the timing goes to pot as well. The cops are supposed to
be waiting at the site of the planned rendezvous and can Mandy get
the phone call over the (presumably short-range) hidden mic that she
is wearing but can't catch up with her for a good 10 minutes despite
the sirens and flashing lights. Martin in contrast is just seconds away
yet goes straight into the factory and doesn't see (or even appear to
check) the car park out front where poor Mandy is laid out cold. Then
he takes no precautions whatsoever and goes in shouting his head off.

A good try, but let down by the writing at the end. I still want to
see the next one though...
