My, Apple really are cleaning up when it comes to thoughtful, high-concept SF with great production
values and great acting aren't they? This is the story of office drones who agree to separate their
"work" minds from their "home" minds, each for their own reasons (as we learn through the season).

The whole feel is both unsettling and subtly menacing,
(interesting grey/green colour grading in the interior scenes, like the Matrix but more subtle);
although not a lot is actually explained
in any meaningful way, even by the series conclusion! There had better be a season two to finish
things up.
