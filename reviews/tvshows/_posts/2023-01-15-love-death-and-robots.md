An innovative showcase of animated stories and techniques. Cleverly done with a good range
of stories. Some of the more violent ones did seem to drag a bit e.g. The Other War, which
was just endlessly bloody (on reflection, possibly an allegory for that war!), but the
Alastair Reynold's inspired episode was excellent and triggers the thought that in 
some ways it is the precursor to the later novel ["Eversions"](/reviews/books/eversions/).
