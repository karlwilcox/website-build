Watching Ncuti Gatwa sometimes seems exhausting so I can't imagine
what it must be like *being* Ncuti Gatwa! Indeed, the mid-season episode
"74 Yards" that was largely a Ruby Sunday single hander
over many years of her life was actually something of a calming relief.
There were some great concepts in this series and both time and money have
been lavishly spent here. To the extent that some parts (e.g. the Beatles
episode) were almost criminally underused for all the effort that had gone
into their recreation - while other elements (like Maestro) over-stayed
their welcome. There were some genuinely shocking, moving, funny and knowing
moments (lots of fan service) and the usual clever story arc / common theme.

So yes, off to a great start Doctor!  I want to see more of you and I
genuinely hope that find Rogue somewhere out there in the infinite universes!
