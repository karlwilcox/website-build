Absolutely loved this - the period details were great (clothes, cars etc.) the story was intriguing, with a clever mix of real world people and events (with footage) cleverly worked in to the narrative. Convincing special effects matched with likeable characters and plausible situations. Square jaws, buzzcuts and plaid trousers abound. Highly recommended.
