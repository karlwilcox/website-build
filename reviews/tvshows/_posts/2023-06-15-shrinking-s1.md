This was great in so many ways. Real people that we care about, witty dialogue,
nice shots of Pasadena and multiple, interesting and intertwined story lines,
this show has it all. The acting is all just perfect and convinving, bringing
us right into the story (stories) and my whole family really looked forward to
each episode.

I can't imagine the thought process that led to the creation of this show as it
doesn't sound like it should be good but perhaps things are different in a land
where everyone has a shrink of their own! I'm glad that it won lots of awards
and am happy that it is has been renewed for a second series.
