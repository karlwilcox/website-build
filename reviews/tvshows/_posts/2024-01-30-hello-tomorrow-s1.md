There's quite some competition between Apple TV+ and Disney+ for the best retro-looking sci-fi show
and we are all the better for it.

So yes, this does have fantastic production values and the acting is fun, even slightly OTT but
I will only grudgingly watch the second season! It started well but by the end of the last
episode I don't think that the plot actually advanced very much, and neither did the characters
or our knowledge of them. We know little more
than we did after 3 episodes and nothing is wrapped up neatly, indeed things are even less
certain now!

I am sort of intriqued about where it goes from here but hope that it moves a little
quicker next season.
