The canvas was too small and the final episode forgot to be fun but I definitely want to see more of this
show (and even more of "The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon"!).

Alexander Skarsgard was good, and his oh-so-dry asides to the audience were some of the funniest moments
in recent TV. The story this season was almost incidental, there was some sort of conspiracy to locate
and recover alien artifacts and corporate foul play but this was never really concluded, just a brief
montage of lots of meetings in the final episode. But really the plot wasn't the point here, it was
just a stage for Murderbot to become a free agent and open up new vistas.

Indeed, the setting is already too small to contain him and his potential and the shuffling back
and forth between bases on that miserable planet did become rather tedious. The characters of the
expedition did all have strong and distinct characters but their story arcs really are now complete
and I am glad that we will be leaving them behind as our hero explores the wider universe.

The special effects (as we have come to expect) are high quality and the actors on the show-within-the-show
played their parts with fantastic earnestness (and the set design was a level above that of the main show!)
and I be happy to see much more as we progress. Please renew for at least another 5 seasons Apple, this was
good and has the potential to be great!
