Disclaimer - I've only watched the first few episodes but already thinking about abandoning it.

The backstory of Captain Nemo (that nobody actually asked for). This is the
story of how Nemo stole the submarine that he helped design whilst a prisoner
of the Bank of Evil- sorry, The East India Mercantile Company. In the process
he loses his best friend and co-collaborator but gains a ragtag crew, soon
supplemented by all the women and child in (2+1) from a schooner they
accidentally ram.

I can't help but compare this with another show with a similar premise, **One Piece**. We
have a ragtag crew on a special craft pursued by the authorities with their top team and
a craft that is the pride of the fleet but the whole feel
is completely different - there is so much more nuance and subtelty.

In **Nautilus** the attempts to give the characters personality comes across as
thin to the point of stereotyping, or plain irritating (and sometimes both).
Every OP character is their own person and fully formed and rounded. In **N**
the bad guys are evil and / or bumbling often presented as "cannon fodder"
(even if the violence is actually quite tame) and generally unlikeable. In OP
on the other hand we know that the admiral cares about his men and wants to
maintain peace and order on the high seas and carry out his allotted task to
the best of his ability. This might put him on a different "side" to Monkey and
his crew but we care about the admiral and his marines just as much as we do
Monkey and friends. "Good" and "bad" are much more fluid (and realistic) in OP.

Disappointing and rather juvenile, although as we have come to expect with big
budget streaming shows the sets, special effects and CGI are top notch. The
consensus however, seems to be that a second series is unlikely, which unless
the writing improves is no great loss.
