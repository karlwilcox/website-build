This was a lot darker than the first season, with more killings, including the sad
case of Katie which initially felt unnecessary but narratively did provide and regret
for Bart. I loved to see all the ships and felt smug spotting the traffic travelling
backwards along the quayside in a brief establishing shot. Character-arc-wise everything
is neatly tied-up - so a third season risks becoming nothing more than a police
procedural and less interesting for it, but I would watch another series if
it appears.
