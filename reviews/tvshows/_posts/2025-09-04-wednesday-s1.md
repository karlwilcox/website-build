Pretty much everything about this was great. Clever writing with lots of witty
lines, fun acting, amazing sets and visual effects and a fast moving story with
lots of twists and turns. Even those characters originally presented as a
villains, like Bianca, we eventually end up liking and feeling sorry for.

Tim Burton didn’t really meddle with his source material too much and did a
fantastic job paying homage to the original characters and taking them to new
places. This well deserves a second series and even makes me want to buy some
merch! A nevermore academy branded back pack, as used by Thing would be so
cool. Next time I am in forbidden planet I’ll see what’s available…

In short, I enormously enjoyed this, even with the scary scenes and
surprisingly high body count it was never less than great fun. There wasn’t a
wasted scene or sentence in this, it was very tightly constructed. It cleverly
weaved together Wednesdays contemporary delinquency with her parents backstory
and some deeper history revolving around the founding of the town of Jericho
end of the Nevermore Academy itself. Very clever writing.

However, I still have questions:

Was Tyler genuinely taken with Wednesday? I kinda think he was.

How did Wednesday persuade Principal Weems to pretend to be Tyler? She seemed
pretty determined to put Wednesday on the train and Wednesday had no new
information with which to convince her? Unless it was a clever double-bluff
cooked up by the two of them? (And why-oh-why didn’t they take back-up with
them?!)

But most of all, why do none of the Nevermore students never attend classes, do
any homework, or, you know, _study_?
