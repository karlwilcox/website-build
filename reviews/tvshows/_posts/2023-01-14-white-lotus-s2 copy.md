Sooo slow, so much padding and so many portentious atmosphere shots of bloody monkeys.
I didn't even care enough
about any of the characters to be interested who died at the end.

I felt that there were way too many hares set running for no real reason, pointless story
lines and wasted talent. I really didn't like this at all, it was
frustrating, claustrophobic and dull I'm afraid.
