I've been wanting to watch this for quite a while since I read the book some years ago (although
I must admit that I had to read it twice before I fully got it, I mistook it for a magical realist
setting). I was about to buy it on Apple TV+ when for no apparent reason Amazon sent me a £5
voucher for Prime TV so I bought it from there instead. Perhaps all these Alexa devices are
interpreting my brainwaves...

Anyhoo... I did enjoy it, it kinda sounds unfilmable but they did a really good job of showing
the disorientating nature of conditioned willing ignorance. The story was easy to follow and
I liked all the characters and both the settings. The faux fonts in English were slightly
grating but otherwise it just reeked atmosphere. A triumph of the film makers art.
