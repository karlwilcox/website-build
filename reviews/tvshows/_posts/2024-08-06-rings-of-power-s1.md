Don't consider this a review as I don't feel I can fully do this show proper
justice since I didn't watch it properly. And that's  because it didn't really
hold my attention I'm afraid...

I think everyone involved in this knew it as a a "big deal", with lots of money
both spent on it and resting on it; and as a result everyone tried just that
bit too hard. The writers were desperate for *new* spectacle so devised
battle scenes that were certainly different but just came across as silly.
The designers devised *new* sailing ships that were certainly elegant, but
realistically impractical, obviously too small for their purported complement
of men and horses yet still too big to fit under the bridge out of the harbour.

I genuinely "lost the plot" after a couple of episodes of not watching closely
and although I was present in the room while the rest of the season played
out I can't honestly remember much of it.

So, in fairness, and in recognition that Season 2 is thought to be a bit better
I decided to give season 1 a re-watch.... but then Amazon ran a long, unskippable
add 20 minutes into the first episode and I was so pissed off I turned off the
TV. Screw you Amazon.

If I ever do get around to watching it properly I'll update you.
