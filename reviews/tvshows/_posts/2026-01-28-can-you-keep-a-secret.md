A solid start with a daft but deftly handled premise about the unfortunate
mis-diagnosis of a husband and a lucky unclaimed body at the funeral directors
setting the scene for an insurance fraud. Dawn French really leans into her
part and some clever writing sustains this far longer than the shaky premise
would suggest. Indeed you could almost see a path to a second series at the end
of the final (sixth) episode but I don’t actually want one - this series stayed
just the right side of cringe and it can’t see it keeping that record any
longer.

Worth a watch all the same, with a lot of laugh-out loud moments and some fun
plot twists.
