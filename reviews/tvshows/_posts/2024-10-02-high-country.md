High Country BBC iPlayer Australian crime drama set in, err, the High Country concerning a 
small town police chief escaping her past ( or is she!)

Well acted and the location itself contributes a sense of eerie beauty-there is 
just so much empty space in Australia. It was 
well acted but took a very unexpected turn in the final couple of episodes and become quite dark.

This is not a show for those that like their stories neatly tied up. Despite solving the 
major crime so much is left unikhown- What will happen to Andie and Helen? How will Andie resolve 
her impossible dilemma? And who did kill Luke?

I don't think this a setup for a second season, it is just treating us as,
adults and recognising that life is messy and the great stories never end.
