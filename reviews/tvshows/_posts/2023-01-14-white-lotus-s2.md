This was a clever slow-burner of a show, even after 5 episodes we were left guessing as
anything could still happen to anybody! The setting, as usual was lovely and the cinematography
was lovely (having all that Italian sunshine probably helps!). Despite the "shock" ending
(which we already knew about from the opener) there were more happy (or at least, not unpleasent)
endings for many of the characters - something of a pleasing contrast to the first season.
