I binge watched this over a couple of nights. It is a police procedural in which the actual crime is less 
interesting than the personal relationships of the cops involved. It also makes a nice change that the bodies aren't piling 
up endlessly (looking at you Taggart) and there is just one fairly straightforward crime to investigate. Obviously there is 
lots of backstory still to come out, it isn't a great show but watchable. Aberdeen isn't coming across as a 
significant "character" like the islands do in "Shetland", and is that harbour side road really such a key highlight?
The two main characters are forever driving up and down it in drone shots while explaining the plot to each other.
