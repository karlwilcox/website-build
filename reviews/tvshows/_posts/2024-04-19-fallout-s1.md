I’ve never played (or even watched) a single minute of any of the Fallout games so I wasn’t sure whether this was for me, but it was great! No forknowledge required! Yet another retro-futuristic look, as always very well done (you can see where the money goes in these streaming shows). Yes, it was super-gory and violent but in a very cartoony way. Plenty of twists and turns and clever interleaving of time periods. Neatly set up for season 2 but equally satisfying within the 8 episodes. Got to be one of the shows of the year!
