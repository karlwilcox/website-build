I really should have paid more attention and watched this show in a less disjointed manner!

This show is always beautiful to look at, especially Trantor and Jared Harris is always
watchable, especially the character of Seldon but to be absolutely honest I wasn't always
iure what was going on for much of the time. I could understand individual scenes but
I lost track of the overall story arc, especially as characters seemed to be older than
their parents and there was more than one Hari!
I think this is my own fault rather than that of the show runners as the
show certainly does not talk down to its audience and expects a certain degree of
attentiveness which I didn't give it.

I feel that for me at least, I would get a lot out of binge re-watch of both seasons
(especially if there is going to be a third one!) so I'm going to add it my list. I
may also re-listen to the official podcast show at the appropriate points as that was
quite interesting too.

To summarise, Apple spent a truckload of money on this show - if I'm going
tos watch it the least I can do in return is pay proper attention!
