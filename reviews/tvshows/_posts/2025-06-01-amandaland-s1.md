Better than I expected, a successful spinoff from motherland that genuinely
took the show in a new direction with interesting characters, situations and
unexpected turns. A brilliant parody of Instagram culture and Joanna Lumley was
priceless as always!

It reminds us all so much of our own days outside the school gate and by the
football pitch with our own children. Perfectly written, both funny and painful
to watch.
