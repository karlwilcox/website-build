A canonical part of the **Sandman** univerise this deserves
kudos for being by far the gayest show on TV - as far as I could tell the only
straight male was a toxic demon. This show isn't afraid of taking chances with
character arcs so there is a great setup for a second season, as long as it
doesn't go all "monster of the week", but I'm not clear on where the stories
of the two boys are going. In some ways they are the least interesting characters,
the two girls are now the driving force! I understand this has been renewed for a
second season so count me as a fan.

## Update - October 2024

I now hear that the second season has been cancelled due to some allegations
against the author and show consultant Neil Gaiman.
