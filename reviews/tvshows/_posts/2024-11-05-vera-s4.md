This is undemanding TV at it's best - and I mean that in the nicest possible way. We like all
the characters, we like the glimpses that detective shows give us into other peoples lives
(almost always more interesting than our own) and there are no over-long car chases
(30 seconds outside the logistics warehouse), noisy explosions (well, a car burnt out maybe)
and not real peril (except will Joe get home in time for tea). And we know that in the
end, following another of Vera's blinding insights that everything will be revealed
and justice will be done. This isn't even a 'whodunnit' in the sense of trying to work
it out for yourself (you often given enough clues anyway) because that's not the point -
it is pure, sit-back-in-your chair and let the story flow over you, low stakes and mild
drama and all.
