Man that was annoying! It started off well enough with some lovely visuals and a slow paced
combination of supernatural mystery and family drama. I watched the first episode when it
was released but then abandoned it - I was worried that my time would be wasted with a
show that set up some great ideas but never managed to explain them - either becuase the
writers made things so weird they tied themselves in knots (e.g. "Lost", so my wife tells
me) or just get cancelled ("Night Sky" - once burned twice shy!). After all it is easy
to write strange, haunting and mysterious elements into your show, it is another thing
entirely to then explain them in a satisfactory way!

But when Season 2 was announced I decided to give the rest of the first season a further look.
It was frustratingly slow at times (perhaps reflective of that Wyoming ranch life) and I
hate that Amazon run ads in a show they told me I'd paid for in my Prime subscription
(petulantly, I turn down the sound and read a book while they're on) but it was
interesting enough to keep me going.

And then we got to the final couple of episodes and it became a real "WTF" experience. I
totally lost any understanding of almost all the characters' motivations. Yes, it was
perfectly clear *what* they were all doing but I have no idea *why* (except for Rhett, who's
desire to just get his girl and take off out of there is perfectly understandable!). How can
I care about characters who just seem to be doing random things? I have literally, "lost
the plot" on this one.

But, yes, dammit, I will be back for season 2 but I'll tackle something else while I let
the resentment burn away...
