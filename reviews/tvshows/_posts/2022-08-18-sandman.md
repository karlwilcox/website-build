This show is a triumph. It is brilliantly cast, looks astounding and is reliably faithful
to its source material. I really enjoyed every aspect of this (although the David Thewlis episode
was kinda bleak) and carefully rationed out the episodes to get maximum enjoyment.

I would also claim that the first 20 minutes of "The Sound of Her Wings" is some of the most
compassionate, moving and powerful television ever made. Sublime.
