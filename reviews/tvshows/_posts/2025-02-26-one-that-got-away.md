Wales set crime drama (lovely accents). Not a great title but I guess that the authors were trying to
reference both the unsolved crime from year's before and the unfinished relationship of the detectives
from that time.

At first glance this is a straight-forward police procedural with a missing nurse in an apparant copy-cat
from a crime in the past, or is it the same person? The original detectives are unwillingly forced together
again and with increasing concern from higher ups and local residents the pressure is on. But what we find
is that their own relationship is just as big a part of the story as their personal lives, current families
and secrets from the past are all mixed together in what becomes quite a compelling case.

I enjoyed this, (although the wardrobe department dressed the female lead in some really awful clothes), the
story was good, it was pretty well acted and I didn't guess the ending so a good effort all round. Based on an
original production in the welsh languagee, if there are more hidden gems like this in the S4C channel vaults
please bring them into the light as well!
