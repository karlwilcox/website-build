Great call out to ST:NG as always. This show is never less than entertaining and we have come to love and 
care about all the characters but it has stayed a long way from its original premise. Obviously our
characters need development arcs but we are a long way from the lower decks now. In the final episode Boimler 
is in command of the Cerritos and Beckett has stolen her own ship! So is this still lower decks? 
Yes, but only because of the character continuity, but the cord is stretched pretty thin and might break 
if we go to 5 seasons.
