I have to say that, having greatly enjoyed season one, I was slightly disappointed with the followup. The story arc meandered somewhat,
with some seemingly pointless episodes. The bizarre aging of the "wunderkid" was totally unconvincing, and his motivation to become
evil didn't really work for me either. Overall, I did watch the whole series as there were moments, especially from the ladies
that made the whole thing worthwhile.
