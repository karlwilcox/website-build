I finally got to the end of this show as it failed to compel a binge watch and
some of the slower episodes caused me to abandon it several times, but there
was *just* enough interest there to draw me back.

This is the story of a slightly fish-out-of-water western wife in a near future
Japan trying investigate the death (or disappeareance?) of here husband and son
with the help of a domestic robot called Sunny (a transliteration of three-two
from Japanese). But can Sunny itself be trusted?

Overall I have to say that this was a brave effort but it didn't really come
off. There were nice insights to Japanese lif and Sunny itself was beautifully
realised but the story still dragged (oh my God, all that time in the damn
forest!) and Rashida Jones had a lot of weight to carry and frankly didn't
quite manage it, she didn't really come across as sympathetic or even
particular interesting (indeed the "should Sunny Wipe Herself" stand-alone
episode was perhaps the most thought provoking).

Should there be a second season? Well I certainly don't need one and I'm not
convinced that the writers do either. They were very keen to explain everything
(perhaps they wanted to avoid a "Lost" situation and ensure that viewers knew
that they did actually know how to resolve everything!). The "hook" for season
2 (a final betrayal) was pretty weak and rather half hearted and didn't really
make any difference to what had come before and I don't actually care enough to
want any more.

A shame really, B for effort but C- for achievement I'm afraid.
