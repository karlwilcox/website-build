I'll make the obvious joke here and say that the real outrage here is that is only half of a
story! (Or even a quarter, we just don't know...).

The life, loves and adventures of the six Mitford sisters (with an occaisional nod to their
brother too). This was historically accurate, certainly in terms of visual appearance, and
from what I know of the period. Lovely costumes, settings and great fun to watch. You
really benefit from a crib-sheet as everyone seems to have over-lapping and often changing
nick names (go on then, which one is "Nads"? No, it isn't Nancy...)

So yes, well worth a watch but every single story line is left unfinished and nothing
is resolved (apart from the sale of the big country estate). If there isn't a second
(or even a third and fourth) season coming down the line I shall eat my television
licence.
