Had I checked on the news sites to find that the second season had been cancelled I may not have watched the first
one as I would have been forewarned that this leaves almost everything unfinished and unexplained!

Anyhoo, watch I did, and did enjoy it. It had a great premise, an old couple that had a tunnel in the garden
that lead to another planet, but just a window onto an apparently airless plain but with glorious sunsets
and skies. The actual story development was a little slow at times, building on the small town vibe
but it did eventually get going a bit further and more was revealed but as I had guessed nothing actually
gets resolved and we are left short-changed with no explanation or closure. Another "Lost" then!
