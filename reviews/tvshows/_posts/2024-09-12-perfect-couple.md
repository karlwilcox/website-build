This took a while to get really started but after a couple of episodes became totally gripping. The story
of a rich (and, as typical, dysfunctional) family meeting in their Nantucket holiday home for the wedding
of one of the 3 sons. There was lots of misdirection and anyone could have carried out the crime (including
the victim herself) so it was good that we were left guessing until the end.

There was one big issue with the slow start in that I probably drifted a bit and thus missed some significant
information that I think must have been imparted early one regarding the terms of an inheritance as that provided
the primary motivation for the final reveal, which hence came as a bit of a surprise. My own fault I guess... But
good acting, clever story and a nice piece of location work. Enjoyed but expect to have little or no impact on
a re-watch.
