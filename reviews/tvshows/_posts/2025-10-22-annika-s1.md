Scottish TV tries to do another Scandi noir import but without the bother of
finding a source novel…

Based on the slightly unlikely premise that any murder which takes place on, or
the victim is find in water is to be investigated by a dedicated unit (the
actress playing the snarky boss later recycled *exactly* the same role in
‘Department Q’) . If you can get past that then I for one really enjoyed this.
We have a nicely diverse team of four always ready with the quips and a lead
detective who breaks the fourth wall to talk to camera, offering glimpses into
her own head along with tidbits from literature and legend that seem to fit the
case. Oh, and she is Norwegian (hence the Scandi connection).

You can argue that this is a bit formulaic (soggy body, obvious suspect,
misdirection and there’s always a chase scene) but it is all handled with
plenty of charm and doesn’t take itself too seriously (Annika herself shouts in
exasperation “Why do they always run?!”). Everything is neatly tied up at the
end of the 50 minute episode and there’s just enough family back story to link
each episode with an on-going arc. I probably don’t watch enough soap-operas
because I honestly didn’t see the final reveal coming!

Will be bingeing season 2 soon…
