Like “the White Lotus“ but 100 times better! They were only half the number of
episodes for a start and no time was wasted on atmospheric shots of vaguely
threatening monkeys or plots that go nowhere.

Two very different sisters are reunited, one successful, one rather less so.
They come together in the holiday home of a fantastic rich couple who appear to
have secrets and run a strange bird worshipping cult. In some ways this
reminded me of Northanger Abbey in that it used all the tropes of the White
Lotus style drama but in the end none of it was actually real, there was no
mysterious cult, there was no Terrible murder being covered up. It was all just
in our own expectations.

Sirens has no body count and not even even a big surprise of evil at the end,
it was just just people,, rich and poor trying to be happy and often screwing
things up in the process. A very human and humane show that was compelling all
the way through. My favourite character was the house manager Jose and his
knowing smirk.
