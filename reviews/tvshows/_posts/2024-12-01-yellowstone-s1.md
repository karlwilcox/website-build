Interim review - episodes 1 to 5

Oh dear, all that money, all those assembled billionaires, the beautiful
scenery and the big houses and *no-one* is remotely happy. The brother and
sister that hate each other, the estranged brother - not mention the dead
brother(s), the vindictive native American leader, Jimmy "hates this job", and
poor old John Dutton (well acted by the way) who looks like he carries the
weight of the world on his shoulders. Even poor little Tate has suffered cuts,
bruises, snake attacks, near drowning and the forced removal of his cousins.
Why can't everyone just be nice to each other and enjoy what they have?

I love the ranch house decor, the horses, the big trucks, the wide open spaces. The plot
does seem to get a bit repetitive (estranged brother shoots someone, the
vindictive reservation head investigates, his family dig him out of a hole); a
Dutton family member stands for office (or at least for one of the posts they
don't already hold); Tate is in peril (again!).

But yes, darn it, I will have to watch the rest of the season because I *do* like
the characters (or at least want to see what happens to them) and perhaps
there is a part of all of us that likes to be reassured that having lots of
money and power doesn't necessarily make you happy!
