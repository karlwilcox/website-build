Transplant of the Jussi Adler-Olsen series of books into Scotland, leaving the
main character names unchanged which has a slight dissonance at times but does
improve the fidelity of the adaptation. Moaning Mrtyle / Bridget Jones pal
Shirley Henderson has a role as a carer and despite being only a year or so
younger than me looks little changed from her stint in the second floor girls
bathroom.

Will watch with interest to see where this goes.

(Later…)

Well, that got pretty exciting at the end, they did ramp the tension quite
nicely. There was rather too much violence and unnecessary gore for my taste, I
don’t think it really needed to be quite so graphic (but that’s what you get
for translating Scandi Noir over to the UK). I think I understand what happened
back in the past with Lyle and Harry, but I’m still not totally clear on why
Lyle then did what he did to “Sam Haig“. So perhaps for as in the audience who
didn’t follow it completely there needed to be a little bit more exposition at
the end but other than that, this really held my attention and I did enjoy it.

The story involves a number of unrelated threads, an initial shooting in which
our main protagonist is shot through the throat; the cold case disappearance of
a prosecutor four years ago; and possible malfeasance in the conduct of the
final case that she was involved in. Other crimes come to light as we go along
and things that originally seem to be connected turn out to be independent so
there are plenty of nice twist and turns which the format of a limited series
allows to develop slowly and fully.

Matthew Goode’s character I initially found a bit annoying, did he really have
to be such a dick all of the time? But after awhile I did warm to him and there
was enough humour in his interactions to humanise him. The supporting
characters, Rose and Akram were excellent and really lifted the show, indeed
the casting and acting throughout was all good.

This richly deserves a second outing and it was both nice (and plausible) to
leave unsolved the initial shooting so that we’ve got something to hang onto
next time around. It was also a clever plot device of the original author to
put pressure on the Lord Advocate to properly fund the Department and therefore
create the ongoing storyline.

Well done to all concerned, just hold back on the buckets of blood for the next
one.
