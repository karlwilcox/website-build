Almost-live-reviewing here, let's see what we think of each episode as we do the
daily(ish) binge watch...

**Episode 1** - In the aftermath of the battle there is resentment aboard the Orville
about the reinstatement of Isaac to active duty. The initial dream / battle sequence
was a bit long and tedious (don't spend all the budget on special effects for
episode 1 guys). The story was OK, and it was a good way to introduce Charly as
the new navigator, although again the testing of the new little runabout was
too long and ultimately a bit pointless, it didn't advance the plot at all. In
general I don't think they are making good use of the extra running time so far.

**Episode 2** - an opportunty to explore uncharted space
leads to an unfortunate alien infection - despite the warnings of the
Krill. Mildly interesting little bit of back story between Dr. Finn and
Paul the admiral but again this episode was just too long (I did skip some
of the corridor chase scenes). Other than the personal relationships this
episode was *very* derivative, which is ironic for a show that derives
almost everything from Star Trek, but in this case they also brought in
all "The Thing" style horror tropes, which I personally dislike so much.
And no-one seemed to give a toss about the loss of all the expendable
crew members turned in aliens and then variously shot, virus-ed and
broken into pieces by the security chief. All seems to be going a bit
heartless and they forgot the fun and banter that made previous seasons
so good.

**Episode 3** - well, that was much better! The crew investigate a once
barren planet now apparently teeming with an advanced civilisation. A
genuinely intriging puzzle piece, nicely acted by the various away teams and
some clever mis-direction in the plot twists. There were even some
funny bits with Gordon almost regaining his season 2 mojo. The big
reveal at the end was a nice call back to a previous episode and
the motivation for all the illusions was interesting, plus there
are hints of further contact with the Q continuum! Sorry, I mean
inhabitants of the multi-phasic planet...

**Episode 4** - this served to move the story arc along on the grand
galactic stage rather than focussing on our favourite crew. The sets
and the CGI planet of the Krill were very impressive, as were those of
future New York, and I did like the multi-species cast of 'Annie'. I'm
not a big fan of space battles they are cheap in narrative terms (even
if expensive in CGI terms). In this case the battle didn't achieve anything
on either side and as usual, no-one seen to care about lives or ships
lost. Would have better writing perhaps to have the fleets stand-off
facing each other and to extract the landing party by some stealthy means
rather than the Star Wars derivative speeder chase - also rather lazy.
Too much noise and explosions not enough smart writing.

**Episode 5** - that was much better! Tightly focussed on the crew, indeed
largely on Topa and his family but with clever call backs to previous
seasons' incidents and to the wider political climate and goings on. Both
Moclan parents were great and at last the full running time was necessary;
but my main reservation, and it applies to
everything I've watched so far is that in a lot of cases the characters
don't actually have *conversations*, they just say their lines to each other
with a helpful pause before the next person speaks. This isn't how conversations
really work, especially when folk are disagreeing or thrashing things out!
We need a firmer hand from the director I feel.

**Episode 6** Well that was a good one! Okay so the setup for time travel was a
combination of techno babble and wishful thinking but once we did get back to
the 21st century then story (and the acting) was good. Of course, the Orville
crew could have just done their mineral mining and skipped back 10 years
without searching out Gordon but then we wouldn't have had those
heart-wrenching scenes. And it was nice to see Isaac the actor for real!

**Episode 7** Another great (if rather convenient!) premise that really brought
the Isaac /Claire relationship onto new levels. The 1950's TV family homage
back on the Kaylon planet was fun, and the planet of Amazon women was a nice
contrast to the Moclans. Clever ending, although a bit of a shame that Isaac
had to go back to his rather limited previous character.

**Episode 8** An episode of two parts that I almost gave up on! Poor Topa
was in danger of becoming the annoying "Wesley Crusher" of the Orville
(although the scene with "Sherlock" Gordon was great). Eventually re-started
my viewer and almost immediately ran into the surprise guest star! OK, it was
massively sign-posted but still came as a surprise to me! It picked up from
there and even managed to move the overall story arc forward, with the long
deserved expulsion of the Moclans (Go Gordon, you said it best). We are obviously
shaping up for a big confrontation with the Kaylon for the series finale, I just
hope that it doesn't degenerate into another big space battle like last time.
(But yes, I did pick up the hints of a new approach to Kaylon strategy in episode
7 - here's hoping...)
