Well I’m one and a half episodes in and whilst this is absolutely beautiful to
look at and the CGI team have obviously had a great time the actual story has
barely advanced beyond the tagline from the publicity about Hell being emptied.
Yes, it is now but the only additional thing we have found out is that one of
the endless is missing. So far great to watch and let it flow over you but lets
move on with the narrative please!

 More to follow…

- Daniel, King of Dreams

I’ve finished, and in the end I did enjoy this. I kinda wished old Morpheus
would lighten up some times and not sound so bloody portentous every time he
opened his mouth but everyone else was great. I liked team dream back in the
realm, especially the new addition Nuala and Delirium was just a delight. The
call backs to earlier episodes were cleverly done and didn’t come over as
gratuitous but genuinely served to move the story onward. Visually the show
remained top-notch and you could tell that some of the scenes were straight
reproductions of comic book panels (the funerary boat going under bridge was
perhaps the clearest example - beautifully done).

The bonus episode was just lovely too, I could watch the delightful Kirby for
hours and it was a poignant tale that stayed just the right side of not being
too heavy handed.

I’m glad that everything was neatly tied up (especially pleased for Joanna
Constantine and the second Corinthian, they deserver a bit of happiness),
knowing that this was the final season actually made for a better finish than
trying to leave loose ends for another series.

A great piece of television and a masterpiece of visualisation.
