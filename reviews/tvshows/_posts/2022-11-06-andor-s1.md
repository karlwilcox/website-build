This was pretty dark but bueatifully realised - a lot of convincing, immmersive
environments. I particularly like the depiction of every-day life on Coruscant.
The story itself was a bit of a slow burner, in that I'm not actually sure we
got too far along in our lead character's story arc but I accept that the 
writers have a fixed endpoint in that we are leading up to the events of 'Rogue One'
and they probably want to squeeze out a few seasons before we actually get there! 
Looking forward to the next season if there's going to be one.
