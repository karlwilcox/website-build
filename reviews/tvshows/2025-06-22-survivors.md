An excellent and faithful adaptation of the novel (apart from the silly
storyline in the book about the shipwreck and the sculpture - it never felt
necessary there and the writers were correct to drop it). The show was well
acted by absolutely everybody, a real ensemble effort. There are lots of
misdirections, lots of damaging secrets being revealed and a believable setting
and small town atmosphere. Nobody comes out of this very well, apart from
pregnant Mia perhaps. You wouldnâ€™t really want to live in this town but it is a
fascinating place to watch events develop. Well done to all concerned.
