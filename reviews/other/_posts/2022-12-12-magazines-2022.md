I realise that I have rather restricted myself in the "culture consumed" postings so far by only listing those things I've actually finished (or at least given up on). That precludes quite a lot of culture that I consumed on a regular, ongoing basis.

Hence, just for completeness here are the magazines that I read most issues of. (This may seem like a lot, but I use the Readly app, which I consider fantastic value for money! I do however also pay for my Economist suscription).
