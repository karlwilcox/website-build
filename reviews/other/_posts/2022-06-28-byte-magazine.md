I've been downloading the PDFs of these from Archive.org and reading them in Apple Books
on my iPad and they are fascinating. I even remember buying some of these issues myself
and the satisfying weight and solidity of some of the thickest magazines I've every known!

The advertisements are interesting period pieces, somewhat sexist at times and suprisingly
"word-heavy" compared to those of today. Some of the articles are now seriously outdated 
but many are of historical interest and almost all of the electronics and circuit
diagrams are still 100% relevant to the hobbyist today. I'm pleased to have these at 
my fingertips again, thanks archive.org!
