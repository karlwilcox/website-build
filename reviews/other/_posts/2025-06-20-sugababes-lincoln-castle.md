An uncrowded viewing platform (VIP Tickets were still being sold so I'm
guessing about 50% capacity), complimentary drinks and food (bulk catering, so
the rice was a bit mushy and the peach tagina was a bit sweet) but the cr√®me caramel
was nice. The support act Freya Ridings played a lovely acoustic set making the
most of her smokey, soulful voice and she did a nice ukulele session too.

It took a while to set up for the main act but when they arrived, they
delivered a great set, one hour and five minutes with all the hits and some nice
choreography. I particularly liked the number in which they accompanied their
younger selves on the video screen. A good band, good venue and well
organised.

Looking forward to the events at the same venue next year.
