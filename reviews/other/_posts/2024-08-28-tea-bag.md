Why would anyone write about a tea bag?!

Because this isn't just *any* tea bag, this is a Harvey Nicholls tea bag that, when you work the individual cost per bag is setting you back the
thick end of 50p! (For comparison typically supermarket tea bags are 2p to 5p each)

So is it worth it? Well we get individual sachets containing what are often referred to as "pyramid" bags but are actually in
the shape of a tetrahedron - a very high quality bag, fine mesh and very strong with a lightly-attached tag and string. 
The mechanical build quality is without a doubt excellent - you'll not be getting a single tea leaf loose in your cup with this baby.

And how does it taste? I admit I wasted the first few by dunking and squeezing then gulping them down with a few chocolate biscuits.
Big mistake, all you can taste is biscuit, this is really a job for lesser tea bags.

Later I actually read the instructions and steeped my bag for 3 minutes in boiled water, then added just a splash of
soya milk and drank it on its own. And yes, it is good! There is not a hint of bitterness that you sometimes get with
cheaper tea bags (is that the tannin?); what you do get is a very pure and fine tea taste with no downsides. I am most
reminded of the things like Yorkshire Tea Loaf which I find has a similar strong but pleasant tea taste.

Would I recommend it for daily consumption? Hell no, unless you are seriously rich.

Would I buy it for a treat now and then? Maybe, it is good but you can buy 1 1/2 paperbacks for the same price.

Would I enjoy receiving or giving as a gift? Both! It is always nice to treat someone or be treated yourself and this
tea is definitely a taste treat!
