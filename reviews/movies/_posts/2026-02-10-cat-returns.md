This is the story of Haru, a typical schoolgirl with typical schoolgirl
problems like boys, homework and family. But she is kind at heart, feeding
stray cats and putting her own life in danger when she sees a cat carelessly
crossing the road. Little does she know that she has saved the life of Prince
lune and the debt is about to be repaid in very unexpected ways!

The storytelling animation is simpler than many Ghibli films but there are some
lovely, and lovingly created establishing shots of Japanese street scenes that
are packed with life and detail.

It is good to see the baron again, although Matu seems to have put on a great
deal of weight since "whispered of the heart". I think it is a bit of a shame
that the story is only result through violence (although no cats seem to be
permanently hurt in the process), it might have been good to resolve things
through negotiation and mutual understanding rather than a big punch up. Even
though there were some lovely moments and the resolution was ultimately
satisfying.

As always there are examples of Ghibli magic and imagination, I lived the idea
of arresting your fall by stepping down an endless staircase of flying crows
and the Kings security cats were just sublime genius.

Not the strongest film from the studio but everything they produce is worth
watching, there are always gems somewhere in the runtime.
