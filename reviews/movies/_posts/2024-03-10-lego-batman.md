The Lego Batman Movie Apple TV+ The final installment of my Lego movie bulk
purchase. This was great fun and turned out to be all about relationships, not
superheroes at all. There good gags about bad guys and an interesting role swap
for Ralph Fiennes. Well worth your time watching.

Fade to white...
