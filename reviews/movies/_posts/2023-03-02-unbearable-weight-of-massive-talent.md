Caper involving a rich Nick Cage super-fan crime boss (or is he?), but donâ€™t worry too much about the plot! Nick has made a second career of taking
the piss out his first career and this is exhibit one. It is surprisingly fun watch with nice scenery and fast moving so if you want a couple of
hours of mindless escape this could be just the thing.
