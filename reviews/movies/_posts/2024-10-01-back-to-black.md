Musical bio-pic of the life of Amy Winehouse. A very convincing lead performance and
a seemingly balanced across each participants point of view but it just seemed
to simplify everything - Amy's career, her relationships and her problems. All the
rough edges, complications and nuances were rubbed away. There were too many
musical interludes - we know all the songs and most of us have streaming
services that can call up at a whim so we don't need to see them performed
(no matter how well). I think the time would have been better used to
tell a more complete story.
