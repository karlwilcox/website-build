Dumb, initially enjoyable action adventure movie completely interchangeable with so
many others. This one has our (inevitable) multiskilled team bound by past
exploits and witty banter trying to find the titular artefact on behalf of a
dying millionaire whilst pursued by the “protectors” (think the Knight’s
Templars from Indiana Jones but with catchier comebacks). Fun locations and
good special effects as we have come to expect from Apple, they’re not afraid
to spend the money and don’t cut corners. Harmless fun, don’t expect it to
strain your grey matter, unless you are a fan of counting implausibilities.

Having said all that, I gave up half way through, after yet another over-long,
over choreographed and totally consequence-free fight scene. Pointless time
filler of the worst kind. There’s probably some kind of clever twist at the
end, probably involving Carver the rich guy bank-rolling it all, but honestly,
I just don’t care enough to give it another hour of my time.
