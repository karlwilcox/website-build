There was a bit of a slow start, needed to set up the context and backstory but the second half barrels along at a 
great pace with all the sight and spoken gags that we have come to expect. And don't forget the cameos, the in-jokes,
movie references and more. "Honey, where are my pants?" was a great call out. The actual story is just a Christmas 
tree on which to hang all these baubles and tinsel.
