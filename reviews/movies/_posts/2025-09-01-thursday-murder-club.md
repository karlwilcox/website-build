There was a *lot* of hype about this so we gave it a go. I must admit to being
a bit of a snob and refusing to read the Richard Osman novel, rather looking
down on it and its readers I’m afraid (I am not a good person), but we will see
what Netflix got for its money…

Argh! I actively hate this! (And I’ve only watched 20 minutes). All of the main
characters are smug and each is irritating in their own special way. I don’t
buy the premise (or the premises for that matter). This is not any old folks
home I know.

Everything is telegraphed far too obviously, it is all too twee and cutesy. It
is obvious that the actors are all having a great time but I’m not.

My 89 year mother loved it though…
