A compelling drama with a well deserved Oscar for sound design. Subtitled but that actually seemed to draw you in 
more deeply, fixing your attention on the screen. I was slightly confused about the inverted colour sections, 
originally I thought they were dream sequences - I don't know if that was deliberate or just an odd choice by the 
director to show nighttime scenes. Overall a very cleverly told story in which surprisingly little happens but so 
much is hinted at. And it inspired me to re-read the Auschwitz book by Laurence Rees.
