A compelling drama with a well deserved Oscar for sound design. Subtitled but
that actually seemed to draw you in more deeply, fixing your attention on the
screen. I was slightly confused about the inverted colour sections, originally
I thought they were dream sequences - I don't know if that was deliberate or
just an odd choice by the director to show nighttime scenes. Overall a very
cleverly told story in which surprisingly little happens but so much is hinted
at. And it inspired me to re-read the Auschwitz book by Laurence Rees.
