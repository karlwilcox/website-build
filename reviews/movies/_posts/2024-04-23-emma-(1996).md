With Gwyneth Paltrow & Toni Collette. A faithful adaptation, nicely done and
well cast, with all the pretty dresses, impressive hair and charming villages
that we have come to expect. I think readers of the book benefitted as I think
would have been hard to follow otherwise, especially familial relationships.
This Janeite enjoyed it immensely!
