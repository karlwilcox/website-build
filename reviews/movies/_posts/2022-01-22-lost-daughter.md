Olivia Coleman was great in this well-acted, claustrophobic mood piece - really not a great advertisement for the shooting location as a holiday destination, no-one seemed to be actually enjoying themselves! Nice ambiguous ending, leaving you unsure which daughter we were concerned with and who was really lost after all.
