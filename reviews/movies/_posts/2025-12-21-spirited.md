A second viewing and now I think it is my favourite Christmas film! Ryan Reynolds
and Will Ferrell reprise (or is it re-prise?) 'A Christmas Carol' as a supernatural
musical.

There is not a wasted frame of this joyous movie - indeed, there is so much going
on it rewards multiple watching of every single, beautiful scene. The songs are
unlikely to win many awards, the acting is (deliberatly) hammy but none of that
matters a jot in a story with real heart and feeling; and visual, spoken and
sound gags coming at you so fast there isn't time to take them all in.

The whole crew deserved their moment of fame in the final scene because the
complexity of the scene changes, the choreography and the fantastic sets
were all state of the art.

I loved this and resolve to watch it at least once every Christmas!
