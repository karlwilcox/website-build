This movie is very silly. Fortunately the makers now this and obviously don't
care. A silly spy caper with more twists and turns than a snake fighting a
mongoose. Great fun, it doesn't take itself at all seriously and has a cat -
what's not to like? (well, apart from the 2 hours plus run time...) I even
enjoyed this a second time around.
