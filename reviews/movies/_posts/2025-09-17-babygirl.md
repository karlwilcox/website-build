Nicole Kidman, a high flying CEO enters a torrid affair with an intern risking
her relationship with her husband Antonio Banderas who seems to have hair and a
beard from different people.

This is a slow burn of a movie, that seems to exist largely for Nicole Kidman
to demonstrate her acting chops. The slow pace means that the movie feels over
long yet still fails to develop many of the characters. The two daughters who
are supposed to be the thing Holding the relationship together are so different
they could be from separate families yet neither is developed in any serious
way.

There was a happy ending of sorts, although the images of Samuel playing with
his dog at the end for a bit Heavy Handed as a comparison to what he was doing
to control Nicole Kidman’s character, Romy.

I think the main problem with this film was that none of the characters were
actually particularly sympathetic so we didn’t care about them. The lack of
character development for the family meant that there didn’t actually seem to
be anything at stake so when it was all resolved there was no sense of relief,
other than we finally reached the two hour mark and the movie was over.
Disappointing.
