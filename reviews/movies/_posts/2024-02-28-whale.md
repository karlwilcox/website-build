A compelling drama with great characters. It had a very "stagey" feel (could easily be put on in a
theatre) but that made for an effective, claustrophobic feel. Clearly deserving of the best actor oscar,
this was the story of a work-from-home tutor who never reveals himself to his students (hey, that
sounds familiar...) 

The ending was nicely ambiguous, leaving us asking whether Ellie really wanted to help or destroy?
