In two words - “watchably bad”. This is undeniably a bad film - outrageous
coincidences, thin plotting, over-acting (or in Michael Bolton’s case
under-acting since he looked like a waxwork), and back projection so laughably
poor that I hope for their sake it was done ironically. And yet it was still
perfectly watchable, even enjoyable, in a harmless, unchallenging way. Everyone
obviously had fun making it and didn’t take themselves or the plot too
seriously. We even had a choreographed group dance on the beach, just like “The
Perfect Couple”, only with considerably ropier dance moves!

To summarise the “plot” four college friends reunite after 30 years for a
wedding (one them under considerable duress). Reconciliation happens, new
opportunities open (and, to be fair, these aren’t always the ones we expect)
and we get some nice travelogue shots of Key West.

A guilty pleasure, and how could you diss a movie that features so many
polydactyl cats!
