This did a good job telling a complicated technical story but the legal and SEC aspects were skimmed over leaving the viewer 
wanting more closure or at least an explanation of why things happened and why that woman was hassling them so much. 
But it was well acted with a good, interesting story which all made for good viewing. Wikipedia called it a comedy / biopic
which isn't quite right - if things were funny it's because that's they way they happened, not because the writer
thought of a funny scene or line.

Minor biographical note here, I had a friend who worked in sales for Research In Motion in Britain and he asked me to trial and 
report back on one of the pre-release UK devices. I was reading my e-mail on my mobile device years before you losers!
