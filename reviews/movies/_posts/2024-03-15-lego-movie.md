This was a re-watch in preparation for watching the whole box set I've purchased for Apple TV.
And boy was it fun, even the second time around. This was a brave move by the filmmakers( and the Lego company) that could have made a straight toy promo. Instead this was inventive, fast moving( very) and irreverent ( both to Lego itself and the world of moves in general) and contoris some great cameos. It also hasn't aged a minute since release and every scene. is packed with detail that beers are-watch as many times as you like.
An important film that shows that tie-ins can be so much more.
