Written and performed by an established folk singer this is the story of the self-confessed
"worst cleaner in Cornwall" and her rediscovery of music thanks to a piano in a empty house
she squats in. There's an unspoken event that ruined her confidence, a hotshot London lawyer
and some quirky locals. The tape in question is (somewhat improbably) found by the very DJ
that we listen to on the radio but we can forgive this as it is clearly necessary for the
story to move to its happy conclusion.

I really loved this - it is quiet, gentle, uplifting with some great music and appealing
characters that make you want to be part of their (stone) circle. Proof of what can
achieved with a minute budget, well done to all concerned.

The soundtrack is recommended also!
