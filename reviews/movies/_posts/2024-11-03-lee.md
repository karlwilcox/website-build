 biopic of model and photographer Lee Miller, brilliantly acted by Kate Winslet
 (who, as my wife insists, is a "real woman"). A huge amount of effort has been
 undertaken to re-create scenes from her life and her photographs with loving
 care and the result is a totally convincing and engrossing story. The
 supporting cast were all great too and a swift consultation of Wikipedia
 afterwards shows that her life was even more full and complicated than the
 film shows. A triumph and a Oscar nomination worthy performance from Kate.
