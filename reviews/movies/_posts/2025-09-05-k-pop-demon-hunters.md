Wow, that was fun! A beautifully animated, colourful and detailed world,
initially it looked like typical hand-painted 2D animation but this was so much
more. You got a real sense of scale and space and the emotions of the
characters were superbly realised. The story-telling was tight, with not a
wasted shot and it was well paced and simply told. I particularly liked the way
that the demons turned the “Takedown” song against Rumi. And I want a plush
blue tiger.

An absolute triumph, brilliant animation, catchy songs, a cool story and the
Twice girls at the end! I could watch this again, and probably will!
