A wonderful evocation of the 1960's in clothes, attitudes, cars and even the almost
Technicolor grading! This was a fun story from the Apollo era with a lot
of great lines, effective scenes and a story with a surprising amount
of depth. The interweaving of the conspiracy theory about the moon
landing hoax was deftly handled and who doesn't like a movie
with a cat playing such a central role in the plot?

I could watch this again and probably spot more loving nods to the period
and the Apollo programme. Good one, Apple!
