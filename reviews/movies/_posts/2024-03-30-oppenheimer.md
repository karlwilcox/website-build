Oppenheimer Sky Cinema For balance with Barbie I also watched Oppenheimer, or at least tried to. I have to admit 
that it didn't really hold my attention. The structure, around the later McCarthy-ite witch hunt and the 
congressional enquiry just didn't work for me. Everybody took everything seriously and I couldn't help feeling that 
I was watching people making a "very important" movie that would clearly be a "major Oscar contender" rather than 
just telling a good story. Maybe I'm not doing it justice( and although I was in the room I wasn't paying attention) 
so don't let me put anyone off watching! It did prompt me to buy "The Making of the Atomic Bomb" however...
