Weak, weak weak. Barely worth my time watching it. This was a derivative
cash-in of the worst kind. The funny moments were a few and far between, the
storyline was pathetic, there was no real peril or even interest. If it wasn't
for the pretty shots of London in Paris(even though they were geographically
very suspect) then I would not have bothered watching this at all. It just
rehashed a few of the ideas from the original film and glued them together with
some over long and rather dull fight scenes and put some really clunky lines in
the mouth of the characters. I expected better of Apple TV here.
