There was never a dull moment in the two and half hours this took to unfold.
Developed over quite a small canvas with only a handful of primary characters
this was great fun. Lots of great (over) acting, clever scenes and framing and
well paced – we don’t even see Benoit Blanc until an hour has passed (cleverly
marked by the priest saying “and that’s what I’ve been doing for the last
hour” at that very moment).

Despite the limited number of suspects there was plenty of misdirection. The
three of us that watched this together all made very different predictions that
all seemed plausible but all mostly incorrect!

Great fun, well done everyone!
