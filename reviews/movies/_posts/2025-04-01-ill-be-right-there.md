The tale of a put-upon mother sandwiched between the competing
demands of troublesome children, interfering mothers, useless ex-husband and assorted lovers, but still somehow happy.
And that is the moral too really,
if you have found your place and are happy in your life you don't need to be always
"moving on" or trying to find you self or the next big thing. It is fine to be content where you are.
And if you can that moral across in a warm, funny film with some great dialogue then so much the better!
Recommended!
