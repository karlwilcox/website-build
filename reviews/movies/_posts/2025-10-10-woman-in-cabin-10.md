Keira Knightley just doesn’t know when to shut up on board an astonishingly
ugly super yacht (presumably Netflix didn’t b build it themselves hired it in
from some existing billionaire, in which case they have absolutely no taste in
interior decor).

This is the show that makes the the life of a Guardian investigative journalist
look really exciting; although in this case our heroine seems to forget all her
journalistic wiles and just keeps whining to everyone that she saw somebody
fall overboard.

There’s quite a clever ending and some good twists and turns along the way. The
bad guy’s chief-of-staff / principal assistant seemed to switch loyalties on
the basis of very little information from Keira but apart from that this was a
fun little move that didn’t overstay its welcome.
