"Hey, lets make another Bridget Jones movie, it’ll be a sure-fire hit!"

And that’s it really, that’s the whole premise and storyline in a nutshell. It
is just another Bridget Jones movie but nobody has any idea what to do with it,
where it should go or what type of movie it should be. Is it a comedy? Does it
have something to say about the aging process and human frailty? Or is it just
the story of Bridget moving on?

I think it tries to be all of these things, but none of them very successfully.
To be honest, not much actually happens and there are story elements that just
don’t seem to go anywhere, like Daniel’s health scare. This film passes the
time pleasantly enough but doesn’t know what it wants to be and fails to live
up to the earlier movies. A bit of a shame, and a waste of a brilliant,
re-assembled cast.
