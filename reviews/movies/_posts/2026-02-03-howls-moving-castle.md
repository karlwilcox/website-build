This was the promised re-watch after reading the original book.

Miyazaki clearly took the main characters, and the initial set up from the
novel, but then used that material to tell a different story, albeit with a
similar concluding episode.

That’s not to suggest the movie is not as good as the book. It is a different
medium and condensing a book that takes many hours to read into a 90 minute
movie is not always easy, especially with a complex book like this one. Major
changes that I noted include removal of the door to our world, no sign of the
dog, and more advanced technologies in the world of Howl.

And of course Miyazaki loves his flying machines and themes of war so these did
form a large part in the revised story. But the characters were very much as
described, and how I imagined them. And this being a Ghibli film the animation
was spectacular – every frame was packed with both beauty and detail and had a
sense of space and dimensionality that can put some real life movie scenes to
shame.

Like every film from this studio there are sublime moments, often not part of
the narrative but just something seen in passing. In this case the best of such
moments was watching delightful countryside pass below us as we stand on the
balcony of the moving castle. As we pass over a stream we see, just for a split
second the blinding reflection of the sun on the water. Genius, and worth
watching for that scene alone.
