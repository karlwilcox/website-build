It has taken me a while to get around to watching this but it was time well spent once I got to
it. This is a surprisingly simple story (girl discovers her power within a magical family) and 
it was told in an equally straightforward fashion, with a good range of diverse characters. 
It was supremely colourful, the songs were fun
and the Pixar technical folk deserve bonus points for the cloth dynamics! Recommend
for adults and children alike.
