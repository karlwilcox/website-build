Ralph Fiennes carries this movie brilliantly. A totally claustrophobic story
with clever foreshadowing (a lead character called Thomas, and the Pope who
keeps pet turtles â€“ did you spot any others?) This sticks very closely to the
book and is better for it, a compelling tale of competing papal candidates who
crash and burn in various ways leading to an unexpected outcome. The direction
and photography were great, really capturing the oppressive feel of the Vatican
city. The arcane and slow voting process added to the tension rather than
slowing the story down. The whole thing was a triumph, and poor old Ralph was
robbed at the Oscars!
