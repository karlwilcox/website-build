Kristen Bell is a workaholic dumped at the altar who, after a drunken night
with her estranged father, Kelsey Grammer, ends up on the honeymoon cruise with
him. The story makes a reasonable stab at setting up the slightly implausible
scenario in a fairly efficient manner and once set it is quite a fun little
film, which does reinforce my prejudices against cruising- not the ship-board
facilities (which are great) but the other passengers (who are hell!)

There are no great revelations, or serious peril and only one major argument
between the main protagonists. This is actually quite a gentle story where the
product placement isn’t just a background element that takes pride of place. It
certainly passes the time and is quite enjoyable but not something that you
would ever want to watch again, unless one were a real fan of Royal Caribbean
cruises!
