A lowkey (but better for it) character study of three very different people thrown together against
their wills for the Christmas holidays in a bleak and deserted private school in the north east
US of 1970. I could see this almost working as a stage play as it is mostly a 3-hander and doesn't
move much but the lingering shots of snowy emptiness and unused classrooms adds significantly to the
feel.

All the leads were great, totally believable with great, understated acting and slow paced but
compelling scenes. And the ending, although superficially a bad outcome was actually uplifting
and life affirming.

A terrific film that deserved its Oscar nominations, if not more actual wins as well.
