Possibly the least appropriate subtitle in television history as it never
stopped bloody raining... Faithful adaptation of the Jane Harper novel (the
least interesting of the Aaron Falk books in my view). A deeply unattractive
"team building" event in a fairly miserable looking forested area with some
unexplained deaths and missing hikers that peripherally brings in Aaron and his
assistant. Slightly implausible in parts but it did tell the story well enough
and held my attention through to the end. This sort of thing can really put you
off team building events (absolutely nobody is having anything like a good time
here) and brings to mind a meme that is going around the household at the
moment FOBI - "Fear of Being Included"!

I'm guessing that they are doing the Falk books in order but my favourite Jane
Harper has been "The Lost Man" and that's the one I would like to see
televised.
