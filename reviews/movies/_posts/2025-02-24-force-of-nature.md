Possibly the least appropriate subtitle in television history as it never stopped bloody raining...
Faithful adaptation of the Jane Harper novel (the least interesting of the Aaron Falk books in my
view). A deeply unattractive "team building" event in a fairly miserable looking forested area
with some unexplained deaths and missing hikers that peripherally brings in Aaron and his assistant.
Slightly implausible in parts but it did tell the story well enough and held my attention through to the end.
This sort of thing can really put you off team building events (absolutely nobody is having anything like
a good time here) and brings to mind a meme that is going
around the household at the moment FOBI - "Fear of Being Included"!

I'm guessing that they are doing the Falk books in order but my favourite Jane Harper has been "The
Lost Man" and that's the one I would like to see televised.
