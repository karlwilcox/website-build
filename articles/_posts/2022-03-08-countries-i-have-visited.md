*   Czech Republic
*   Cyprus
*   Denmark
*   Egypt
*   France
*   Germany

The foreign country I have spent the longest time in is the United States, probably 3 or 4 months in total, the shortest time was likely to be Denmark, just long enough to get a bus from Copenhagen airport and onto a fast ferry to Malmö (This was before the Öresund link opened).
