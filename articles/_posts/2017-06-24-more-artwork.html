Some more artwork here - did you know there is a layer in the clouds of Venus, around 50km up where the temperature and pressure are similar to Earth? What’s more, a human breathable atmosphere would actually be a lifting gas at that height. Sounds like an ideal place for a floating city, so here’s my take on what it might look like.

<p style="">I created this in Affinity Designer, a program I am coming to be more impressed with every time I use it. Everything that you see here is a vector object with a gradient fill - no brushwork here!</p>
