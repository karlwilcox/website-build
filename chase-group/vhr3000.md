A correspondent has provided a photograph of the front panel of a
Chase Electrics VHR3000 interference measuring receiver in a 19"
rack mouting.

I'm afraid I don't know anything about this device as I didn't
work on it during my time with Chase electrics, although I'm sure
I could operate it using the very clear front panel controls. If you
can provide any information about this device please let me know
using the form below.

Other photographs, kindly provided by Nick can be found below.
