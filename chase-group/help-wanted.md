## Do You Have Information on Chase Products?

Do you have any documentation (manuals, promotional material, circuit
diagrams...) for Chase Group products? Would you be willing to scan or
photograph these and allow them to be posted here for free access by
anyone interested? If so, please get in touch via the contact form
at the bottom of this page. All information gratefully received and your
contribution will be acknowledged if you so wish.

I'm also happy to include any stories or memories of times that you worked
with Chase Group equipment, or anything else that you would like to share -
just get in touch!

__Please Note__ I'm just looking for information here and intend to make
it available for anyone interested. I have no budget to buy any Chase
Group products and am not intending to purchase or soliciting any offers.

## Current Requests

A correspondent asks for any information on the __Chase Electrics VHR 3000__ interference
measuring receiver, in particular, what does error code 80 mean? If you have any
documentation, information, or even just some memories of using it, please get in 
touch.
