The Chase Systems was an innovative but not particularly successful Unix
computer system of the mid 1980s.

The innovative part (and hence its name) was the dual processor approach - a
Motorola 68000 CPU runs a standard Unix Operating System, while an Intel 80186
co-processor with a custom written "mini" OS provides all the device driver
services like hard disk management, serial comms, the real-time clock and so
on.

I don't have a lot of information on this device, other than the promotional
brochure that was produced. (Sorry about the image quality, I will re-scan this
soon with the half-tone option selected.)
