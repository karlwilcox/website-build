## Background

The GPR40 range of interference measuring radio receivers were developed by a
British company, Chase Electronics, based (when I joined them at least) in a
two storey industrial building, St. Leonards House, close to Mortlake railway
station in East Sheen, South London.

The GPR40 was a highly specialised device, each of which was hand built, with a
list price of around £10,000 in 1986.

At some point the rights to the devices was sold to a German company, Willtek
Communications GmbH.

## Copyright Information

No copyright infringement is intended here. As far as I am aware all the
material copyright remains with the original authors (largely Willtek
Communications GmbH, but also RSi of Staines, Middx.). I am providing copies in
the hope that they are useful but will comply with any requests by the
legitimate copyright holders.

## Model Numbers

I am aware of the following models, please use the contact page if you can add
any more information to the list!

### GPR40.1

Presumably this existed as at least a prototype but it was before my time

### GPR40.2 / Willtek 8100

This is the version that I worked on. At some point the rights appear to have
been sold to Willtek GmbH of Ismaning, Germany.

## Flyers and Manuals

Promotional material and basic user manuals can be found 
[on this page.](/chase-group/gpr40/promotional-material/)

## Circuit Diagrams

Schematic diagrams of the electrical circuits can be found on 
[a separate page](/chase-group/gpr40/circuit-diagrams/).

## Assembly Diagrams

A partial set of assembly diagrams showing the main physical sections of the
reciever [can be found here.](/chase-group/gpr40/assembly-diagrams/)

## Remote Operation

It is possible to control all the functions of the GPR 40 over an RS232 serial
interface. Full details of this [can be found here](/chase-group/gpr40/remote-operation/) 
(this was my major contribution to the GPR reciever development).

## Calibration Process

I was given a complete set of programs to calibrate the receiver but this
relies on some equipment (both expensive and old) which I don't have access to.
There may be useful information that can be gleaned from reading the program
code however. For what it is worth
[all the information can be found here](/chase-group/gpr40/calibration/).

## Associated Software - Promotional Materials

Software was written to take advantage of the GPR remote comms features,
largely involving mapping cellular signal strength.
[Flyers for these products can be found here.](/chase-group/gpr40/software-promotional-materials/)
