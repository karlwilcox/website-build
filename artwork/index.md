Over the years I have dabbled in various art media and quite enjoyed it, although
I can't lay claim to any great talent or artistry. I have collected the best of
my work here, not in the expectation that it will ever adorn anyone's wall (or
desktop background) but largely as a reminder and inspiration to myself to keep
producing new work as it is fun, and good for mental well-being.

And if any of it does inspire any readers to develop their own creations then
that is a pleasant bonus!

Artworks are presented in galleries of thumbnails like the example
above. Click on any of the thumbnails to see a larger version and a brief description.

I have organised the work by various categories in the sidebar menu (so you will see duplicates if
you visit every page here).
