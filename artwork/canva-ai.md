## Beachfront Cafe

__a photograph taken from a table in an open-air beach front restaurant. The
restaurant overlooks a beach in a small cove with bushes trees and rocks either
side. Waves gently lap at the beach and an empty canoe is on the beach. It is a
sunny day with high cirrus clouds.__

A pretty attempt at what I was imagining, no complaints here. I did try some
video generation here, asking canva to animate the waves breaking and the trees
swaying in the breeze, and it did that well but moved the camera. I was hoping
to loop the video so I tried again explicitly stating "keep the camera", it
confirmed it would and then moved it even faster(!)

## Buccolic Fields

__A bucolic rural landscape of fields, fences and small copses is framed by two
large oak trees. It is a bright sunny day with scattered cumulus cloud. A farm
track leads off into distance. A tractor is working in a nearby field. There is
a taller range of heather covered hills in the distance.__

This is pretty much almost exactly how I imaged it and is probably one of my most "successful" images.
