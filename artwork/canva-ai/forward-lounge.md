__We are looking into the lounge area of a spaceship. The carpet is red with
blue sofas. Pot plants and low tables with drinks, snacks and candles in glass
on them scattered around and there is an open fire pit in the centre with a
lit fire and copper flue leading to the ceiling above it. The lighting is
subdued with small lights inset in the ceiling. There are tall windows curving
away from the lounge through which we can see a star scape and the curve of an
earth like planet. There are a few information screens on the walls showing
technical data.__

Candles in wrong place...
