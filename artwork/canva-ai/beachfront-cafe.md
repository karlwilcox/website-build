A pretty attempt at what I was imagining, no complaints here. I did try some
video generation here, asking canva to animate the waves breaking and the trees
swaying in the breeze, and it did that well but moved the camera. I was hoping
to loop the video so I tried again explicitly stating "keep the camera", it
confirmed it would and then moved it even faster(!)
