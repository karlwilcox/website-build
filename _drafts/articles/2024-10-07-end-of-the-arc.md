Do story arcs limit crime series?

I really like the story arcs of my crime fighting characters, they add depth and interest
and can interact in interesting ways with the process of your actual crime solving. The 
problem with this is that the more a character *does* develop, the greater the weight
of that history ("baggage" is a good term"!). And that baggage can constrain stories, or
at least require some plot convolutions.

Characters having kids (or adopting them) is a typical example - often a dramatic arrival
or inclusion in the story in which they first appear they then become a problem in
subsequent stories where they have to be looked by someone else, until such time as
they fall in with the wrong sort or get kidnapped for dramatic effect.
