I have always enjoyed creating images, drawing, painting or realistic 3D
graphics; typically vistas of imaged places that I can mentally place myself in
as a distraction from my rather insular and unexciting village life.

I’ve been largely ignoring AI image generators as I felt they have developed
either an unsavoury reputation (used to create harmful or hateful fakes) or a
poor reputation (unrealistic or just downright wierd AI slop). But a free month
of Canvas AI has persuaded me to take a proper look and to also investigate
open source locally hosted alternatives. These are my considered reflections
after a few days investigation (so don’t expect any hugely profound thoughts or
startling insights!)

I started by trying to reproduce one of my favourite 3D images (link) that I
created with much effort in Vue D’esprit, a now discontinued 3D package. I
wrote a brief description in Canva AI, pressed the button and, initially at
least was greatly impressed.

(Prompt and image)

Looking more closely, the interior of the boat is very vague, the radio mast in the city is poorly defined and the building to the right has some “ghost” windows. But in terms of effort versus reward there was no contest and even this imperfect image is now on my desktop…

So I tried some other sci-fi things, great success with giant spaceships floating above planets, even basing the visual style on one of my own Pov-ray images. Less success with the interior of a space habitat, I just couldn’t find the words to wrap the landscape around the inside of a cylinder.

Let’s try something probably better represented in the source material, a beach side cafe and a countryside scene. Both of these are greatly impressive and matched my interior vision, arguably the buccolic farming vista 

I also had considerable success combining the familiar and domestic with the science fiction theme – for example I would be very pleased to invite you to share drinks and snacks in the forward lounge of my spaceship (just don’t trip over the candles randomly placed on the floor!)

Arguably the bucolic countryside is rather saturated and a little “cartoon-like” but that is fine by me and the composition exactly matches what I had in mind.

The park is bigger than I wanted (I did describe it as “small” but I guess that is subjective – I wonder if we can use absolute sizes…?)

Overall however I am very impressed with the first pass image generation.

Less completely successful were subsequent modifications. Removals were fine, taking a beer glass off the cafe table was done well but additions were pretty awful – I forgot to specify a car should have occupants. Adding them later ended up with faces pasted onto the windscreen that were almost comically bad. And lightening the sky above the city made its uncertain walls even fuzzier.

My most recent trial is by far the best (must be getting used to the style the prompting expects). My visualisation of a winery verandah is remarkable both for its photographic verisimilitude and its adherence to my original vision. Really pleased with this one.

In contrast, I followed some instructions to install Stable Diffusion on my Mac Mini and successfully running the suggested demo a cat – good, I thought, I’m set.
